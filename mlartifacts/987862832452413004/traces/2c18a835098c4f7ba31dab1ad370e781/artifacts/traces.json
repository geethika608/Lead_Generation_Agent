Do not stop until you reach this number. Only include leads that STRONGLY MATCH your search criteria and meet all quality standards. MAINTAIN YOUR RUNNING LIST of leads to avoid duplicates and track progress accurately. \\\"\\n\\n\\nReasoning Plan:\\n1. **Understanding of the Task:** The goal is to generate exactly 10 high-quality leads that significantly align with the user's specified search strategy. The focus is on doctors in top medical universities in the USA with titles such as chief, professor, author, teacher, director, founder, and doctor, ensuring they are in decision-making or influential positions and that their profiles are complete and active.  \\n\\n2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**  \\n   - Initialize an empty lead list and define criteria for high-quality leads.  \\n   - Begin with a direct search using the user's provided strategy to extract potential leads.  \\n   - Evaluate each lead against the quality criteria: title, relevance, decision-making authority, completeness of profile, and engagement.  \\n   - Track and manage the list to ensure uniqueness, avoiding duplicates based on name and company combination.  \\n   - If the target of 10 leads is not met, utilize additional search strategies, including keyword variations, industry specifics, location bases, job titles, and companies.  \\n   - Repeat the search until I have exactly 10 unique qualified leads.  \\n   - After each search, report the progress of unique qualified leads found.  \\n\\n3. **Challenges and Solutions:**  \\n   - Challenge: Identifying high-quality leads could be hindered by incomplete profiles or inactive individuals.  \\n     - Solution: Use multiple validated sources and check engagement levels (e.g., LinkedIn interactions) to confirm activity.  \\n   - Challenge: Potential duplicate leads.  \\n     - Solution: Maintain a systematic recording and real-time verification of each lead before adding it to the list.  \\n\\n4. **Use of Available Tools:**  \\n   - I will use the Serper tool to conduct direct searches and find leads specified in the search strategy (medical universities, doctor roles).  \\n   - I will employ systematic keyword variations and related searches to enhance the breadth and quality of potential leads.  \\n   - Execute multiple calls to find relevant individuals in specified roles across several sources such as LinkedIn and university directories.  \\n\\n5. **Expected Outcome:** The output will be a JSON array containing exactly 10 high-quality lead objects that include the name, email, company, title, and LinkedIn profile URL. This will perfectly align with the user's goals of identifying qualified prospects in medicine within US universities, ensuring all quality and relevance criteria are met.  \\n\\nI feel confident in the plan developed and the structured approach outlined. I am now ready to utilize the SERPER tool for this task.  \\n\", \"name\": \"scrape_leads\", \"expected_output\": \"\\\"JSON array of lead objects with name, email, company, title, and linkedin fields\\\"\\n\", \"summary\": \"\\\"TARGET: Generate EXACTLY 10 HIGH-QUALITY leads using the user's search...\", \"raw\": \"Here are the 10 high-quality leads extracted from the search results for doctors with leadership roles at top medical universities in the USA.\", \"pydantic\": null, \"json_dict\": null, \"agent\": \"\\\"Lead Scraper - Target: 10 HIGH-QUALITY leads\\\"\\n\", \"output_format\": \"raw\"}, {\"description\": \"\\\"Find email addresses for leads using multiple search strategies and sources.

The focus is on doctors in top medical universities in the USA with titles such as chief, professor, author, teacher, director, founder, and doctor, ensuring they are in decision-making or influential positions and that their profiles are complete and active.  \\n\\n2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**  \\n   - Initialize an empty lead list and define criteria for high-quality leads.  \\n   - Begin with a direct search using the user's provided strategy to extract potential leads.  \\n   - Evaluate each lead against the quality criteria: title, relevance, decision-making authority, completeness of profile, and engagement.  \\n   - Track and manage the list to ensure uniqueness, avoiding duplicates based on name and company combination.  \\n   - If the target of 10 leads is not met, utilize additional search strategies, including keyword variations, industry specifics, location bases, job titles, and companies.  \\n   - Repeat the search until I have exactly 10 unique qualified leads.  \\n   - After each search, report the progress of unique qualified leads found.  \\n\\n3. **Challenges and Solutions:**  \\n   - Challenge: Identifying high-quality leads could be hindered by incomplete profiles or inactive individuals.  \\n     - Solution: Use multiple validated sources and check engagement levels (e.g., LinkedIn interactions) to confirm activity.  \\n   - Challenge: Potential duplicate leads.  \\n     - Solution: Maintain a systematic recording and real-time verification of each lead before adding it to the list.  \\n\\n4. **Use of Available Tools:**  \\n   - I will use the Serper tool to conduct direct searches and find leads specified in the search strategy (medical universities, doctor roles).  \\n   - I will employ systematic keyword variations and related searches to enhance the breadth and quality of potential leads.  \\n   - Execute multiple calls to find relevant individuals in specified roles across several sources such as LinkedIn and university directories.  \\n\\n5. **Expected Outcome:** The output will be a JSON array containing exactly 10 high-quality lead objects that include the name, email, company, title, and LinkedIn profile URL. This will perfectly align with the user's goals of identifying qualified prospects in medicine within US universities, ensuring all quality and relevance criteria are met.  \\n\\nI feel confident in the plan developed and the structured approach outlined.

Do not stop until you reach this number. Only include leads that STRONGLY MATCH your search criteria and meet all quality standards. MAINTAIN YOUR RUNNING LIST of leads to avoid duplicates and track progress accurately. \\\"\\n\\n\\nReasoning Plan:\\n1. **Understanding of the Task**: The primary goal is to find and extract 50 high-quality leads who are doctors currently working in top hospitals or universities in the US. The leads should include titles such as doctor, CEO, president, founder, manager, director, chief, or officer, and should be decision-makers in their respective organizations. It is imperative to maintain a running list to avoid duplicates and ensure that all leads completely fulfill the quality criteria outlined.\\n\\n2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task**: \\n   - Initialize an empty list for tracking found leads. \\n   - Begin with the user's search strategy (focused on doctors in high-ranking institutions). \\n   - Conduct searches using different approaches: direct search, keyword variations, industry-specific terms, and focusing on job titles and companies.\\n   - For each lead obtained, evaluate them against the quality criteria and check for duplicates before adding them to the list.\\n   - Keep a running count of unique qualified leads and report the progress after each search.\\n\\n3. **Approaching Challenges**: Challenges may include the potential lack of leads that perfectly meet the criteria under certain approaches. To address this, I will implement a mix of all search approaches systematically to increase the chances of finding relevant leads while remaining flexible to pivot if one approach does not yield enough results. If necessary, additional targeted search criteria will be incorporated to refine results further.\\n\\n4. **Strategic Use of Available Tools**: The primary tool available is the internet search engine (Serper). I will leverage this tool in the following manner:  \\n   - Conduct direct searches for profiles relevant to the hierarchy specified (doctors and C-level executives) with location filters (top hospitals/universities in the US).  \\n   - Implement keyword variations to broaden the pool of prospects. \\n   - Utilize specific terms associated with hospitals/universities to generate leads from multiple sources (e.g., LinkedIn, hospital staff lists, university directories).\\n   - Retrieve as much information as possible from found links to maintain thorough records (including name, company, title, and potential LinkedIn profile).\\n   - Ensure all findings are tailored to maintain quality as per the criteria established by the user.\\n\\n5. **Expected Outcome**: The expected output is a JSON array of exactly 50 unique high-quality lead objects, each containing full name, email, company, title, and LinkedIn profile URL. The outcome will strongly align with the goal, fulfilling the user’s requirements for booking demos through correctly targeted leads while adhering strictly to the quality metrics mentioned.\\n\"}, \"context\": \"```\\nThought: I have identified more potential leads in healthcare leadership based on the latest search results.

The focus is on doctors in top medical universities in the USA with titles such as chief, professor, author, teacher, director, founder, and doctor, ensuring they are in decision-making or influential positions and that their profiles are complete and active.  \\n\\n2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**  \\n   - Initialize an empty lead list and define criteria for high-quality leads.  \\n   - Begin with a direct search using the user's provided strategy to extract potential leads.  \\n   - Evaluate each lead against the quality criteria: title, relevance, decision-making authority, completeness of profile, and engagement.  \\n   - Track and manage the list to ensure uniqueness, avoiding duplicates based on name and company combination.  \\n   - If the target of 10 leads is not met, utilize additional search strategies, including keyword variations, industry specifics, location bases, job titles, and companies.  \\n   - Repeat the search until I have exactly 10 unique qualified leads.  \\n   - After each search, report the progress of unique qualified leads found.  \\n\\n3. **Challenges and Solutions:**  \\n   - Challenge: Identifying high-quality leads could be hindered by incomplete profiles or inactive individuals.  \\n     - Solution: Use multiple validated sources and check engagement levels (e.g., LinkedIn interactions) to confirm activity.  \\n   - Challenge: Potential duplicate leads.  \\n     - Solution: Maintain a systematic recording and real-time verification of each lead before adding it to the list.  \\n\\n4. **Use of Available Tools:**  \\n   - I will use the Serper tool to conduct direct searches and find leads specified in the search strategy (medical universities, doctor roles).  \\n   - I will employ systematic keyword variations and related searches to enhance the breadth and quality of potential leads.  \\n   - Execute multiple calls to find relevant individuals in specified roles across several sources such as LinkedIn and university directories.  \\n\\n5. **Expected Outcome:** The output will be a JSON array containing exactly 10 high-quality lead objects that include the name, email, company, title, and LinkedIn profile URL. This will perfectly align with the user's goals of identifying qualified prospects in medicine within US universities, ensuring all quality and relevance criteria are met.  \\n\\nI feel confident in the plan developed and the structured approach outlined.

Direct Search: Use the exact search strategy provided by the user 2. Keyword Variations: Modify the search strategy with different keywords 3. Industry-Specific: Add industry terms to the search strategy 4. Location-Based: Add location terms to the search strategy 5. Job Title Focus: Add job title terms to the search strategy 6. Company Focus: Add company-specific terms to the search strategy\\nLEAD TRACKING AND DEDUPLICATION: - Maintain a running list of ALL leads found so far - Check each new lead against your existing list to avoid duplicates - Use name + company combination to identify unique leads - Only add leads that are not already in your list - Keep track of total unique leads found across all searches\\nEXECUTION PLAN: 1. Initialize an empty list to track all found leads 2. Start with the user's search strategy, extract leads, EVALUATE EACH LEAD for quality 3. For each lead found, check if it's already in your list (deduplicate) 4. Only add NEW, QUALIFIED leads that meet ALL quality criteria 5. Count only UNIQUE leads toward your target 6. If you haven't reached 10 QUALIFIED leads, try keyword variations 7. Continue through all approaches until you have exactly 10 high-quality leads 8. After each search, report: \\\"Found X UNIQUE QUALIFIED leads so far, need Y more\\\" 9. Do not stop until you have exactly 10 unique leads that meet quality standards\\nLEAD EVALUATION PROCESS: For each potential lead found: - Check if their title/role matches target clients - Verify their company is relevant to search strategy - Ensure they have decision-making authority - Confirm their profile is complete and professional - Check if this lead is already in your running list (deduplicate) - Only include if they meet ALL quality criteria AND are not duplicates\\nPROGRESS TRACKING: - Keep a running count of unique qualified leads - After each search, update your count and report progress - Example: \\\"Search 1: Found 5 new qualified leads. Total: 5/50\\\" - Example: \\\"Search 2: Found 3 new qualified leads. Total: 8/50\\\" - Continue until you reach exactly 10 unique qualified leads\\nOUTPUT FORMAT: Return a JSON array with exactly 10 HIGH-QUALITY lead objects, each containing: - name: Lead's full name - company: Company name - title: Job title - linkedin: LinkedIn profile URL (if available) - email: (leave empty, will be filled by email finder)\\nREMEMBER: Your target is 10 HIGH-QUALITY leads. Do not stop until you reach this number. Only include leads that STRONGLY MATCH your search criteria and meet all quality standards. MAINTAIN YOUR RUNNING LIST of leads to avoid duplicates and track progress accurately. \\\"\\n\\n\\nReasoning Plan:\\n1. **Understanding of the Task:** The goal is to generate exactly 10 high-quality leads that significantly align with the user's specified search strategy. The focus is on doctors in top medical universities in the USA with titles such as chief, professor, author, teacher, director, founder, and doctor, ensuring they are in decision-making or influential positions and that their profiles are complete and active.  \\n\\n2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**  \\n   - Initialize an empty lead list and define criteria for high-quality leads.  \\n   - Begin with a direct search using the user's provided strategy to extract potential leads.  \\n   - Evaluate each lead against the quality criteria: title, relevance, decision-making authority, completeness of profile, and engagement.  \\n   - Track and manage the list to ensure uniqueness, avoiding duplicates based on name and company combination.  \\n   - If the target of 10 leads is not met, utilize additional search strategies, including keyword variations, industry specifics, location bases, job titles, and companies.  \\n   - Repeat the search until I have exactly 10 unique qualified leads.  \\n   - After each search, report the progress of unique qualified leads found.  \\n\\n3. **Challenges and Solutions:**  \\n   - Challenge: Identifying high-quality leads could be hindered by incomplete profiles or inactive individuals.  \\n     - Solution: Use multiple validated sources and check engagement levels (e.g., LinkedIn interactions) to confirm activity.  \\n   - Challenge: Potential duplicate leads.  \\n     - Solution: Maintain a systematic recording and real-time verification of each lead before adding it to the list.  \\n\\n4. **Use of Available Tools:**  \\n   - I will use the Serper tool to conduct direct searches and find leads specified in the search strategy (medical universities, doctor roles).  \\n   - I will employ systematic keyword variations and related searches to enhance the breadth and quality of potential leads.  \\n   - Execute multiple calls to find relevant individuals in specified roles across several sources such as LinkedIn and university directories.  \\n\\n5. **Expected Outcome:** The output will be a JSON array containing exactly 10 high-quality lead objects that include the name, email, company, title, and LinkedIn profile URL. This will perfectly align with the user's goals of identifying qualified prospects in medicine within US universities, ensuring all quality and relevance criteria are met.  \\n\\nI feel confident in the plan developed and the structured approach outlined. I am now ready to utilize the SERPER tool for this task.  \\n\\n\\nThis is the expected criteria for your final answer: \\\"JSON array of lead objects with name, email, company, title, and linkedin fields\\\"\\n\\nyou MUST return the actual complete content as the final answer, not a summary.\\n\\n# Useful context: \\nRecent Insights:\\n- ```\\nThought: I have identified more potential leads in healthcare leadership based on the latest search results. Here are the relevant leaders to add:\\n\\n1. Dr. Steven J. Corwin - President and CEO of NewYork-Presbyterian.\\n2. Dr. Corona - CEO of SUNY Upstate Medical University Hospital.\\n3. Richard E.

Direct Search: Use the exact search strategy provided by the user 2. Keyword Variations: Modify the search strategy with different keywords 3. Industry-Specific: Add industry terms to the search strategy 4. Location-Based: Add location terms to the search strategy 5. Job Title Focus: Add job title terms to the search strategy 6. Company Focus: Add company-specific terms to the search strategy\\nLEAD TRACKING AND DEDUPLICATION: - Maintain a running list of ALL leads found so far - Check each new lead against your existing list to avoid duplicates - Use name + company combination to identify unique leads - Only add leads that are not already in your list - Keep track of total unique leads found across all searches\\nEXECUTION PLAN: 1. Initialize an empty list to track all found leads 2. Start with the user's search strategy, extract leads, EVALUATE EACH LEAD for quality 3. For each lead found, check if it's already in your list (deduplicate) 4. Only add NEW, QUALIFIED leads that meet ALL quality criteria 5. Count only UNIQUE leads toward your target 6. If you haven't reached 10 QUALIFIED leads, try keyword variations 7. Continue through all approaches until you have exactly 10 high-quality leads 8. After each search, report: \\\"Found X UNIQUE QUALIFIED leads so far, need Y more\\\" 9. Do not stop until you have exactly 10 unique leads that meet quality standards\\nLEAD EVALUATION PROCESS: For each potential lead found: - Check if their title/role matches target clients - Verify their company is relevant to search strategy - Ensure they have decision-making authority - Confirm their profile is complete and professional - Check if this lead is already in your running list (deduplicate) - Only include if they meet ALL quality criteria AND are not duplicates\\nPROGRESS TRACKING: - Keep a running count of unique qualified leads - After each search, update your count and report progress - Example: \\\"Search 1: Found 5 new qualified leads. Total: 5/50\\\" - Example: \\\"Search 2: Found 3 new qualified leads. Total: 8/50\\\" - Continue until you reach exactly 10 unique qualified leads\\nOUTPUT FORMAT: Return a JSON array with exactly 10 HIGH-QUALITY lead objects, each containing: - name: Lead's full name - company: Company name - title: Job title - linkedin: LinkedIn profile URL (if available) - email: (leave empty, will be filled by email finder)\\nREMEMBER: Your target is 10 HIGH-QUALITY leads. Do not stop until you reach this number. Only include leads that STRONGLY MATCH your search criteria and meet all quality standards. MAINTAIN YOUR RUNNING LIST of leads to avoid duplicates and track progress accurately. \\\"\\n\\n\\nReasoning Plan:\\n1. **Understanding of the Task:** The goal is to generate exactly 10 high-quality leads that significantly align with the user's specified search strategy. The focus is on doctors in top medical universities in the USA with titles such as chief, professor, author, teacher, director, founder, and doctor, ensuring they are in decision-making or influential positions and that their profiles are complete and active.  \\n\\n2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**  \\n   - Initialize an empty lead list and define criteria for high-quality leads.  \\n   - Begin with a direct search using the user's provided strategy to extract potential leads.  \\n   - Evaluate each lead against the quality criteria: title, relevance, decision-making authority, completeness of profile, and engagement.  \\n   - Track and manage the list to ensure uniqueness, avoiding duplicates based on name and company combination.  \\n   - If the target of 10 leads is not met, utilize additional search strategies, including keyword variations, industry specifics, location bases, job titles, and companies.  \\n   - Repeat the search until I have exactly 10 unique qualified leads.  \\n   - After each search, report the progress of unique qualified leads found.  \\n\\n3. **Challenges and Solutions:**  \\n   - Challenge: Identifying high-quality leads could be hindered by incomplete profiles or inactive individuals.  \\n     - Solution: Use multiple validated sources and check engagement levels (e.g., LinkedIn interactions) to confirm activity.  \\n   - Challenge: Potential duplicate leads.  \\n     - Solution: Maintain a systematic recording and real-time verification of each lead before adding it to the list.  \\n\\n4. **Use of Available Tools:**  \\n   - I will use the Serper tool to conduct direct searches and find leads specified in the search strategy (medical universities, doctor roles).  \\n   - I will employ systematic keyword variations and related searches to enhance the breadth and quality of potential leads.  \\n   - Execute multiple calls to find relevant individuals in specified roles across several sources such as LinkedIn and university directories.  \\n\\n5. **Expected Outcome:** The output will be a JSON array containing exactly 10 high-quality lead objects that include the name, email, company, title, and LinkedIn profile URL. This will perfectly align with the user's goals of identifying qualified prospects in medicine within US universities, ensuring all quality and relevance criteria are met.  \\n\\nI feel confident in the plan developed and the structured approach outlined. I am now ready to utilize the SERPER tool for this task.  \\n\\n\\nThis is the expected criteria for your final answer: \\\"JSON array of lead objects with name, email, company, title, and linkedin fields\\\"\\n\\nyou MUST return the actual complete content as the final answer, not a summary.\\n\\n# Useful context: \\nRecent Insights:\\n- ```\\nThought: I have identified more potential leads in healthcare leadership based on the latest search results. Here are the relevant leaders to add:\\n\\n1. Dr. Steven J. Corwin - President and CEO of NewYork-Presbyterian.\\n2. Dr. Corona - CEO of SUNY Upstate Medical University Hospital.\\n3. Richard E.

Company Focus: Add company-specific terms to the search strategy\\nLEAD TRACKING AND DEDUPLICATION: - Maintain a running list of ALL leads found so far - Check each new lead against your existing list to avoid duplicates - Use name + company combination to identify unique leads - Only add leads that are not already in your list - Keep track of total unique leads found across all searches\\nEXECUTION PLAN: 1. Initialize an empty list to track all found leads 2. Start with the user's search strategy, extract leads, EVALUATE EACH LEAD for quality 3. For each lead found, check if it's already in your list (deduplicate) 4. Only add NEW, QUALIFIED leads that meet ALL quality criteria 5. Count only UNIQUE leads toward your target 6. If you haven't reached 10 QUALIFIED leads, try keyword variations 7. Continue through all approaches until you have exactly 10 high-quality leads 8. After each search, report: \\\"Found X UNIQUE QUALIFIED leads so far, need Y more\\\" 9. Do not stop until you have exactly 10 unique leads that meet quality standards\\nLEAD EVALUATION PROCESS: For each potential lead found: - Check if their title/role matches target clients - Verify their company is relevant to search strategy - Ensure they have decision-making authority - Confirm their profile is complete and professional - Check if this lead is already in your running list (deduplicate) - Only include if they meet ALL quality criteria AND are not duplicates\\nPROGRESS TRACKING: - Keep a running count of unique qualified leads - After each search, update your count and report progress - Example: \\\"Search 1: Found 5 new qualified leads. Total: 5/50\\\" - Example: \\\"Search 2: Found 3 new qualified leads. Total: 8/50\\\" - Continue until you reach exactly 10 unique qualified leads\\nOUTPUT FORMAT: Return a JSON array with exactly 10 HIGH-QUALITY lead objects, each containing: - name: Lead's full name - company: Company name - title: Job title - linkedin: LinkedIn profile URL (if available) - email: (leave empty, will be filled by email finder)\\nREMEMBER: Your target is 10 HIGH-QUALITY leads.

The focus is on doctors in top medical universities in the USA with titles such as chief, professor, author, teacher, director, founder, and doctor, ensuring they are in decision-making or influential positions and that their profiles are complete and active.  \\n\\n2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**  \\n   - Initialize an empty lead list and define criteria for high-quality leads.  \\n   - Begin with a direct search using the user's provided strategy to extract potential leads.  \\n   - Evaluate each lead against the quality criteria: title, relevance, decision-making authority, completeness of profile, and engagement.  \\n   - Track and manage the list to ensure uniqueness, avoiding duplicates based on name and company combination.  \\n   - If the target of 10 leads is not met, utilize additional search strategies, including keyword variations, industry specifics, location bases, job titles, and companies.  \\n   - Repeat the search until I have exactly 10 unique qualified leads.  \\n   - After each search, report the progress of unique qualified leads found.  \\n\\n3. **Challenges and Solutions:**  \\n   - Challenge: Identifying high-quality leads could be hindered by incomplete profiles or inactive individuals.  \\n     - Solution: Use multiple validated sources and check engagement levels (e.g., LinkedIn interactions) to confirm activity.  \\n   - Challenge: Potential duplicate leads.  \\n     - Solution: Maintain a systematic recording and real-time verification of each lead before adding it to the list.  \\n\\n4. **Use of Available Tools:**  \\n   - I will use the Serper tool to conduct direct searches and find leads specified in the search strategy (medical universities, doctor roles).  \\n   - I will employ systematic keyword variations and related searches to enhance the breadth and quality of potential leads.  \\n   - Execute multiple calls to find relevant individuals in specified roles across several sources such as LinkedIn and university directories.  \\n\\n5. **Expected Outcome:** The output will be a JSON array containing exactly 10 high-quality lead objects that include the name, email, company, title, and LinkedIn profile URL. This will perfectly align with the user's goals of identifying qualified prospects in medicine within US universities, ensuring all quality and relevance criteria are met.  \\n\\nI feel confident in the plan developed and the structured approach outlined. I am now ready to utilize the SERPER tool for this task.  \\n\\n\\nThis is the expected criteria for your final answer: \\\"JSON array of lead objects with name, email, company, title, and linkedin fields\\\"\\n\\nyou MUST return the actual complete content as the final answer, not a summary.\\n\\n# Useful context: \\nRecent Insights:\\n- ```\\nThought: I have identified more potential leads in healthcare leadership based on the latest search results.

Direct Search: Use the exact search strategy provided by the user 2. Keyword Variations: Modify the search strategy with different keywords 3. Industry-Specific: Add industry terms to the search strategy 4. Location-Based: Add location terms to the search strategy 5. Job Title Focus: Add job title terms to the search strategy 6. Company Focus: Add company-specific terms to the search strategy\\nLEAD TRACKING AND DEDUPLICATION: - Maintain a running list of ALL leads found so far - Check each new lead against your existing list to avoid duplicates - Use name + company combination to identify unique leads - Only add leads that are not already in your list - Keep track of total unique leads found across all searches\\nEXECUTION PLAN: 1. Initialize an empty list to track all found leads 2. Start with the user's search strategy, extract leads, EVALUATE EACH LEAD for quality 3. For each lead found, check if it's already in your list (deduplicate) 4. Only add NEW, QUALIFIED leads that meet ALL quality criteria 5. Count only UNIQUE leads toward your target 6. If you haven't reached 10 QUALIFIED leads, try keyword variations 7. Continue through all approaches until you have exactly 10 high-quality leads 8. After each search, report: \\\"Found X UNIQUE QUALIFIED leads so far, need Y more\\\" 9. Do not stop until you have exactly 10 unique leads that meet quality standards\\nLEAD EVALUATION PROCESS: For each potential lead found: - Check if their title/role matches target clients - Verify their company is relevant to search strategy - Ensure they have decision-making authority - Confirm their profile is complete and professional - Check if this lead is already in your running list (deduplicate) - Only include if they meet ALL quality criteria AND are not duplicates\\nPROGRESS TRACKING: - Keep a running count of unique qualified leads - After each search, update your count and report progress - Example: \\\"Search 1: Found 5 new qualified leads. Total: 5/50\\\" - Example: \\\"Search 2: Found 3 new qualified leads. Total: 8/50\\\" - Continue until you reach exactly 10 unique qualified leads\\nOUTPUT FORMAT: Return a JSON array with exactly 10 HIGH-QUALITY lead objects, each containing: - name: Lead's full name - company: Company name - title: Job title - linkedin: LinkedIn profile URL (if available) - email: (leave empty, will be filled by email finder)\\nREMEMBER: Your target is 10 HIGH-QUALITY leads. Do not stop until you reach this number. Only include leads that STRONGLY MATCH your search criteria and meet all quality standards. MAINTAIN YOUR RUNNING LIST of leads to avoid duplicates and track progress accurately. \\\"\\n\\n\\nReasoning Plan:\\n1. **Understanding of the Task:** The goal is to generate exactly 10 high-quality leads that significantly align with the user's specified search strategy. The focus is on doctors in top medical universities in the USA with titles such as chief, professor, author, teacher, director, founder, and doctor, ensuring they are in decision-making or influential positions and that their profiles are complete and active.  \\n\\n2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**  \\n   - Initialize an empty lead list and define criteria for high-quality leads.  \\n   - Begin with a direct search using the user's provided strategy to extract potential leads.  \\n   - Evaluate each lead against the quality criteria: title, relevance, decision-making authority, completeness of profile, and engagement.  \\n   - Track and manage the list to ensure uniqueness, avoiding duplicates based on name and company combination.  \\n   - If the target of 10 leads is not met, utilize additional search strategies, including keyword variations, industry specifics, location bases, job titles, and companies.  \\n   - Repeat the search until I have exactly 10 unique qualified leads.  \\n   - After each search, report the progress of unique qualified leads found.  \\n\\n3. **Challenges and Solutions:**  \\n   - Challenge: Identifying high-quality leads could be hindered by incomplete profiles or inactive individuals.  \\n     - Solution: Use multiple validated sources and check engagement levels (e.g., LinkedIn interactions) to confirm activity.  \\n   - Challenge: Potential duplicate leads.  \\n     - Solution: Maintain a systematic recording and real-time verification of each lead before adding it to the list.  \\n\\n4. **Use of Available Tools:**  \\n   - I will use the Serper tool to conduct direct searches and find leads specified in the search strategy (medical universities, doctor roles).  \\n   - I will employ systematic keyword variations and related searches to enhance the breadth and quality of potential leads.  \\n   - Execute multiple calls to find relevant individuals in specified roles across several sources such as LinkedIn and university directories.  \\n\\n5. **Expected Outcome:** The output will be a JSON array containing exactly 10 high-quality lead objects that include the name, email, company, title, and LinkedIn profile URL. This will perfectly align with the user's goals of identifying qualified prospects in medicine within US universities, ensuring all quality and relevance criteria are met.  \\n\\nI feel confident in the plan developed and the structured approach outlined. I am now ready to utilize the SERPER tool for this task.  \\n\\n\\nThis is the expected criteria for your final answer: \\\"JSON array of lead objects with name, email, company, title, and linkedin fields\\\"\\n\\nyou MUST return the actual complete content as the final answer, not a summary.\\n\\n# Useful context: \\nRecent Insights:\\n- ```\\nThought: I have identified more potential leads in healthcare leadership based on the latest search results.

Direct Search: Use the exact search strategy provided by the user 2. Keyword Variations: Modify the search strategy with different keywords 3. Industry-Specific: Add industry terms to the search strategy 4. Location-Based: Add location terms to the search strategy 5. Job Title Focus: Add job title terms to the search strategy 6. Company Focus: Add company-specific terms to the search strategy\\nLEAD TRACKING AND DEDUPLICATION: - Maintain a running list of ALL leads found so far - Check each new lead against your existing list to avoid duplicates - Use name + company combination to identify unique leads - Only add leads that are not already in your list - Keep track of total unique leads found across all searches\\nEXECUTION PLAN: 1. Initialize an empty list to track all found leads 2. Start with the user's search strategy, extract leads, EVALUATE EACH LEAD for quality 3. For each lead found, check if it's already in your list (deduplicate) 4. Only add NEW, QUALIFIED leads that meet ALL quality criteria 5. Count only UNIQUE leads toward your target 6. If you haven't reached 10 QUALIFIED leads, try keyword variations 7. Continue through all approaches until you have exactly 10 high-quality leads 8. After each search, report: \\\"Found X UNIQUE QUALIFIED leads so far, need Y more\\\" 9. Do not stop until you have exactly 10 unique leads that meet quality standards\\nLEAD EVALUATION PROCESS: For each potential lead found: - Check if their title/role matches target clients - Verify their company is relevant to search strategy - Ensure they have decision-making authority - Confirm their profile is complete and professional - Check if this lead is already in your running list (deduplicate) - Only include if they meet ALL quality criteria AND are not duplicates\\nPROGRESS TRACKING: - Keep a running count of unique qualified leads - After each search, update your count and report progress - Example: \\\"Search 1: Found 5 new qualified leads. Total: 5/50\\\" - Example: \\\"Search 2: Found 3 new qualified leads. Total: 8/50\\\" - Continue until you reach exactly 10 unique qualified leads\\nOUTPUT FORMAT: Return a JSON array with exactly 10 HIGH-QUALITY lead objects, each containing: - name: Lead's full name - company: Company name - title: Job title - linkedin: LinkedIn profile URL (if available) - email: (leave empty, will be filled by email finder)\\nREMEMBER: Your target is 10 HIGH-QUALITY leads. Do not stop until you reach this number. Only include leads that STRONGLY MATCH your search criteria and meet all quality standards.

The focus is on doctors in top medical universities in the USA with titles such as chief, professor, author, teacher, director, founder, and doctor, ensuring they are in decision-making or influential positions and that their profiles are complete and active.  \\n\\n2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**  \\n   - Initialize an empty lead list and define criteria for high-quality leads.  \\n   - Begin with a direct search using the user's provided strategy to extract potential leads.  \\n   - Evaluate each lead against the quality criteria: title, relevance, decision-making authority, completeness of profile, and engagement.  \\n   - Track and manage the list to ensure uniqueness, avoiding duplicates based on name and company combination.  \\n   - If the target of 10 leads is not met, utilize additional search strategies, including keyword variations, industry specifics, location bases, job titles, and companies.  \\n   - Repeat the search until I have exactly 10 unique qualified leads.  \\n   - After each search, report the progress of unique qualified leads found.  \\n\\n3. **Challenges and Solutions:**  \\n   - Challenge: Identifying high-quality leads could be hindered by incomplete profiles or inactive individuals.  \\n     - Solution: Use multiple validated sources and check engagement levels (e.g., LinkedIn interactions) to confirm activity.  \\n   - Challenge: Potential duplicate leads.  \\n     - Solution: Maintain a systematic recording and real-time verification of each lead before adding it to the list.  \\n\\n4. **Use of Available Tools:**  \\n   - I will use the Serper tool to conduct direct searches and find leads specified in the search strategy (medical universities, doctor roles).  \\n   - I will employ systematic keyword variations and related searches to enhance the breadth and quality of potential leads.  \\n   - Execute multiple calls to find relevant individuals in specified roles across several sources such as LinkedIn and university directories.  \\n\\n5. **Expected Outcome:** The output will be a JSON array containing exactly 10 high-quality lead objects that include the name, email, company, title, and LinkedIn profile URL. This will perfectly align with the user's goals of identifying qualified prospects in medicine within US universities, ensuring all quality and relevance criteria are met.  \\n\\nI feel confident in the plan developed and the structured approach outlined. I am now ready to utilize the SERPER tool for this task.  \\n\\n\\nThis is the expected criteria for your final answer: \\\"JSON array of lead objects with name, email, company, title, and linkedin fields\\\"\\n\\nyou MUST return the actual complete content as the final answer, not a summary.\\n\\n# Useful context: \\nRecent Insights:\\n- ```\\nThought: I have identified more potential leads in healthcare leadership based on the latest search results.

Focus ONLY on prospects that are PERFECTLY RELEVANT to the user's search strategy and target audience.\\nUser Input: Search Strategy: doctors working in top medical universities in USA Target Clients: ['cheif', 'professor', 'author', 'teacher', 'director', 'founder', 'doctor'] Campaign Agenda: demo Maximum Leads: 10 (THIS IS YOUR TARGET - DO NOT STOP UNTIL YOU REACH THIS NUMBER) Search Depth: 3\\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS: - You MUST generate exactly 10 leads - ONLY include leads that STRONGLY MATCH your search criteria - Each lead must be HIGHLY RELEVANT to the user's search strategy - Do not stop until you have exactly 10 high-quality leads - Track your progress and report how many QUALIFIED leads you have found - Use the search strategy provided by the user - Use multiple search approaches to reach the target - MAINTAIN A RUNNING LIST of all found leads to avoid duplicates\\nQUALITY CRITERIA FOR VALID LEADS: - Lead's role/title must DIRECTLY MATCH the target clients specified - Lead's company/industry must be RELEVANT to the search strategy - Lead must be in a DECISION-MAKING or INFLUENTIAL position - Lead must have a COMPLETE profile with name, company, and title - Lead must be ACTIVE and ENGAGED in their professional role - Lead's background must ALIGN with the campaign agenda\\nSEARCH APPROACHES (Use these systematically with the user's search strategy): 1. Direct Search: Use the exact search strategy provided by the user 2. Keyword Variations: Modify the search strategy with different keywords 3. Industry-Specific: Add industry terms to the search strategy 4. Location-Based: Add location terms to the search strategy 5. Job Title Focus: Add job title terms to the search strategy 6. Company Focus: Add company-specific terms to the search strategy\\nLEAD TRACKING AND DEDUPLICATION: - Maintain a running list of ALL leads found so far - Check each new lead against your existing list to avoid duplicates - Use name + company combination to identify unique leads - Only add leads that are not already in your list - Keep track of total unique leads found across all searches\\nEXECUTION PLAN: 1. Initialize an empty list to track all found leads 2. Start with the user's search strategy, extract leads, EVALUATE EACH LEAD for quality 3. For each lead found, check if it's already in your list (deduplicate) 4. Only add NEW, QUALIFIED leads that meet ALL quality criteria 5. Count only UNIQUE leads toward your target 6. If you haven't reached 10 QUALIFIED leads, try keyword variations 7. Continue through all approaches until you have exactly 10 high-quality leads 8. After each search, report: \\\"Found X UNIQUE QUALIFIED leads so far, need Y more\\\" 9. Do not stop until you have exactly 10 unique leads that meet quality standards\\nLEAD EVALUATION PROCESS: For each potential lead found: - Check if their title/role matches target clients - Verify their company is relevant to search strategy - Ensure they have decision-making authority - Confirm their profile is complete and professional - Check if this lead is already in your running list (deduplicate) - Only include if they meet ALL quality criteria AND are not duplicates\\nPROGRESS TRACKING: - Keep a running count of unique qualified leads - After each search, update your count and report progress - Example: \\\"Search 1: Found 5 new qualified leads. Total: 5/50\\\" - Example: \\\"Search 2: Found 3 new qualified leads. Total: 8/50\\\" - Continue until you reach exactly 10 unique qualified leads\\nOUTPUT FORMAT: Return a JSON array with exactly 10 HIGH-QUALITY lead objects, each containing: - name: Lead's full name - company: Company name - title: Job title - linkedin: LinkedIn profile URL (if available) - email: (leave empty, will be filled by email finder)\\nREMEMBER: Your target is 10 HIGH-QUALITY leads. Do not stop until you reach this number. Only include leads that STRONGLY MATCH your search criteria and meet all quality standards. MAINTAIN YOUR RUNNING LIST of leads to avoid duplicates and track progress accurately. \\\"\\n\\n\\nReasoning Plan:\\n1. **Understanding of the Task:** The goal is to generate exactly 10 high-quality leads that significantly align with the user's specified search strategy. The focus is on doctors in top medical universities in the USA with titles such as chief, professor, author, teacher, director, founder, and doctor, ensuring they are in decision-making or influential positions and that their profiles are complete and active.  \\n\\n2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**  \\n   - Initialize an empty lead list and define criteria for high-quality leads.  \\n   - Begin with a direct search using the user's provided strategy to extract potential leads.  \\n   - Evaluate each lead against the quality criteria: title, relevance, decision-making authority, completeness of profile, and engagement.  \\n   - Track and manage the list to ensure uniqueness, avoiding duplicates based on name and company combination.  \\n   - If the target of 10 leads is not met, utilize additional search strategies, including keyword variations, industry specifics, location bases, job titles, and companies.  \\n   - Repeat the search until I have exactly 10 unique qualified leads.  \\n   - After each search, report the progress of unique qualified leads found.  \\n\\n3. **Challenges and Solutions:**  \\n   - Challenge: Identifying high-quality leads could be hindered by incomplete profiles or inactive individuals.  \\n     - Solution: Use multiple validated sources and check engagement levels (e.g., LinkedIn interactions) to confirm activity.  \\n   - Challenge: Potential duplicate leads.  \\n     - Solution: Maintain a systematic recording and real-time verification of each lead before adding it to the list.  \\n\\n4. **Use of Available Tools:**  \\n   - I will use the Serper tool to conduct direct searches and find leads specified in the search strategy (medical universities, doctor roles).  \\n   - I will employ systematic keyword variations and related searches to enhance the breadth and quality of potential leads.  \\n   - Execute multiple calls to find relevant individuals in specified roles across several sources such as LinkedIn and university directories.  \\n\\n5. **Expected Outcome:** The output will be a JSON array containing exactly 10 high-quality lead objects that include the name, email, company, title, and LinkedIn profile URL. This will perfectly align with the user's goals of identifying qualified prospects in medicine within US universities, ensuring all quality and relevance criteria are met.  \\n\\nI feel confident in the plan developed and the structured approach outlined. I am now ready to utilize the SERPER tool for this task.  \\n\"}, \"agent\": \"\\\"Lead Scraper - Target: 10 HIGH-QUALITY leads\\\"\\n\"}", "mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"2c18a835098c4f7ba31dab1ad370e781\""}, "status": {"message": "", "code": "STATUS_CODE_OK"}}, {"trace_id": "Q/t9VO4KpiubVzrQ9J5p9g==", "span_id": "R+gUuVjfzFM=", "trace_state": "", "parent_span_id": "tnbIzBMNpbY=", "name": "CrewAgentExecutor._create_long_term_memory_1", "start_time_unix_nano": 1752424495565614000, "end_time_unix_nano": 1752424511630549000, "attributes": {"mlflow.spanOutputs": "null", "mlflow.spanType": "\"RETRIEVER\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"output\": {\"thought\": \"Thought: I have found more potential leads from the latest search results, which include some esteemed professionals in top US medical universities.

Focus ONLY on prospects that are PERFECTLY RELEVANT to the user's search strategy and target audience.\\nUser Input: Search Strategy: doctors working in top medical universities in USA Target Clients: ['cheif', 'professor', 'author', 'teacher', 'director', 'founder', 'doctor'] Campaign Agenda: demo Maximum Leads: 10 (THIS IS YOUR TARGET - DO NOT STOP UNTIL YOU REACH THIS NUMBER) Search Depth: 3\\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS: - You MUST generate exactly 10 leads - ONLY include leads that STRONGLY MATCH your search criteria - Each lead must be HIGHLY RELEVANT to the user's search strategy - Do not stop until you have exactly 10 high-quality leads - Track your progress and report how many QUALIFIED leads you have found - Use the search strategy provided by the user - Use multiple search approaches to reach the target - MAINTAIN A RUNNING LIST of all found leads to avoid duplicates\\nQUALITY CRITERIA FOR VALID LEADS: - Lead's role/title must DIRECTLY MATCH the target clients specified - Lead's company/industry must be RELEVANT to the search strategy - Lead must be in a DECISION-MAKING or INFLUENTIAL position - Lead must have a COMPLETE profile with name, company, and title - Lead must be ACTIVE and ENGAGED in their professional role - Lead's background must ALIGN with the campaign agenda\\nSEARCH APPROACHES (Use these systematically with the user's search strategy): 1. Direct Search: Use the exact search strategy provided by the user 2. Keyword Variations: Modify the search strategy with different keywords 3. Industry-Specific: Add industry terms to the search strategy 4. Location-Based: Add location terms to the search strategy 5. Job Title Focus: Add job title terms to the search strategy 6. Company Focus: Add company-specific terms to the search strategy\\nLEAD TRACKING AND DEDUPLICATION: - Maintain a running list of ALL leads found so far - Check each new lead against your existing list to avoid duplicates - Use name + company combination to identify unique leads - Only add leads that are not already in your list - Keep track of total unique leads found across all searches\\nEXECUTION PLAN: 1. Initialize an empty list to track all found leads 2. Start with the user's search strategy, extract leads, EVALUATE EACH LEAD for quality 3. For each lead found, check if it's already in your list (deduplicate) 4. Only add NEW, QUALIFIED leads that meet ALL quality criteria 5. Count only UNIQUE leads toward your target 6. If you haven't reached 10 QUALIFIED leads, try keyword variations 7. Continue through all approaches until you have exactly 10 high-quality leads 8. After each search, report: \\\"Found X UNIQUE QUALIFIED leads so far, need Y more\\\" 9. Do not stop until you have exactly 10 unique leads that meet quality standards\\nLEAD EVALUATION PROCESS: For each potential lead found: - Check if their title/role matches target clients - Verify their company is relevant to search strategy - Ensure they have decision-making authority - Confirm their profile is complete and professional - Check if this lead is already in your running list (deduplicate) - Only include if they meet ALL quality criteria AND are not duplicates\\nPROGRESS TRACKING: - Keep a running count of unique qualified leads - After each search, update your count and report progress - Example: \\\"Search 1: Found 5 new qualified leads. Total: 5/50\\\" - Example: \\\"Search 2: Found 3 new qualified leads. Total: 8/50\\\" - Continue until you reach exactly 10 unique qualified leads\\nOUTPUT FORMAT: Return a JSON array with exactly 10 HIGH-QUALITY lead objects, each containing: - name: Lead's full name - company: Company name - title: Job title - linkedin: LinkedIn profile URL (if available) - email: (leave empty, will be filled by email finder)\\nREMEMBER: Your target is 10 HIGH-QUALITY leads. Do not stop until you reach this number. Only include leads that STRONGLY MATCH your search criteria and meet all quality standards. MAINTAIN YOUR RUNNING LIST of leads to avoid duplicates and track progress accurately. \\\"\\n\\n\\nReasoning Plan:\\n1. **Understanding of the Task:** The goal is to generate exactly 10 high-quality leads that significantly align with the user's specified search strategy. The focus is on doctors in top medical universities in the USA with titles such as chief, professor, author, teacher, director, founder, and doctor, ensuring they are in decision-making or influential positions and that their profiles are complete and active.  \\n\\n2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**  \\n   - Initialize an empty lead list and define criteria for high-quality leads.  \\n   - Begin with a direct search using the user's provided strategy to extract potential leads.  \\n   - Evaluate each lead against the quality criteria: title, relevance, decision-making authority, completeness of profile, and engagement.  \\n   - Track and manage the list to ensure uniqueness, avoiding duplicates based on name and company combination.  \\n   - If the target of 10 leads is not met, utilize additional search strategies, including keyword variations, industry specifics, location bases, job titles, and companies.  \\n   - Repeat the search until I have exactly 10 unique qualified leads.  \\n   - After each search, report the progress of unique qualified leads found.  \\n\\n3. **Challenges and Solutions:**  \\n   - Challenge: Identifying high-quality leads could be hindered by incomplete profiles or inactive individuals.  \\n     - Solution: Use multiple validated sources and check engagement levels (e.g., LinkedIn interactions) to confirm activity.  \\n   - Challenge: Potential duplicate leads.  \\n     - Solution: Maintain a systematic recording and real-time verification of each lead before adding it to the list.  \\n\\n4. **Use of Available Tools:**  \\n   - I will use the Serper tool to conduct direct searches and find leads specified in the search strategy (medical universities, doctor roles).  \\n   - I will employ systematic keyword variations and related searches to enhance the breadth and quality of potential leads.  \\n   - Execute multiple calls to find relevant individuals in specified roles across several sources such as LinkedIn and university directories.  \\n\\n5. **Expected Outcome:** The output will be a JSON array containing exactly 10 high-quality lead objects that include the name, email, company, title, and LinkedIn profile URL. This will perfectly align with the user's goals of identifying qualified prospects in medicine within US universities, ensuring all quality and relevance criteria are met.  \\n\\nI feel confident in the plan developed and the structured approach outlined.

Direct Search: Use the exact search strategy provided by the user 2. Keyword Variations: Modify the search strategy with different keywords 3. Industry-Specific: Add industry terms to the search strategy 4. Location-Based: Add location terms to the search strategy 5. Job Title Focus: Add job title terms to the search strategy 6. Company Focus: Add company-specific terms to the search strategy\\nLEAD TRACKING AND DEDUPLICATION: - Maintain a running list of ALL leads found so far - Check each new lead against your existing list to avoid duplicates - Use name + company combination to identify unique leads - Only add leads that are not already in your list - Keep track of total unique leads found across all searches\\nEXECUTION PLAN: 1. Initialize an empty list to track all found leads 2. Start with the user's search strategy, extract leads, EVALUATE EACH LEAD for quality 3. For each lead found, check if it's already in your list (deduplicate) 4. Only add NEW, QUALIFIED leads that meet ALL quality criteria 5. Count only UNIQUE leads toward your target 6. If you haven't reached 10 QUALIFIED leads, try keyword variations 7. Continue through all approaches until you have exactly 10 high-quality leads 8. After each search, report: \\\"Found X UNIQUE QUALIFIED leads so far, need Y more\\\" 9. Do not stop until you have exactly 10 unique leads that meet quality standards\\nLEAD EVALUATION PROCESS: For each potential lead found: - Check if their title/role matches target clients - Verify their company is relevant to search strategy - Ensure they have decision-making authority - Confirm their profile is complete and professional - Check if this lead is already in your running list (deduplicate) - Only include if they meet ALL quality criteria AND are not duplicates\\nPROGRESS TRACKING: - Keep a running count of unique qualified leads - After each search, update your count and report progress - Example: \\\"Search 1: Found 5 new qualified leads. Total: 5/50\\\" - Example: \\\"Search 2: Found 3 new qualified leads. Total: 8/50\\\" - Continue until you reach exactly 10 unique qualified leads\\nOUTPUT FORMAT: Return a JSON array with exactly 10 HIGH-QUALITY lead objects, each containing: - name: Lead's full name - company: Company name - title: Job title - linkedin: LinkedIn profile URL (if available) - email: (leave empty, will be filled by email finder)\\nREMEMBER: Your target is 10 HIGH-QUALITY leads. Do not stop until you reach this number. Only include leads that STRONGLY MATCH your search criteria and meet all quality standards. MAINTAIN YOUR RUNNING LIST of leads to avoid duplicates and track progress accurately. \\\"\\n\\n\\nReasoning Plan:\\n1. **Understanding of the Task:** The goal is to generate exactly 10 high-quality leads that significantly align with the user's specified search strategy. The focus is on doctors in top medical universities in the USA with titles such as chief, professor, author, teacher, director, founder, and doctor, ensuring they are in decision-making or influential positions and that their profiles are complete and active.  \\n\\n2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**  \\n   - Initialize an empty lead list and define criteria for high-quality leads.  \\n   - Begin with a direct search using the user's provided strategy to extract potential leads.  \\n   - Evaluate each lead against the quality criteria: title, relevance, decision-making authority, completeness of profile, and engagement.  \\n   - Track and manage the list to ensure uniqueness, avoiding duplicates based on name and company combination.  \\n   - If the target of 10 leads is not met, utilize additional search strategies, including keyword variations, industry specifics, location bases, job titles, and companies.  \\n   - Repeat the search until I have exactly 10 unique qualified leads.  \\n   - After each search, report the progress of unique qualified leads found.  \\n\\n3. **Challenges and Solutions:**  \\n   - Challenge: Identifying high-quality leads could be hindered by incomplete profiles or inactive individuals.  \\n     - Solution: Use multiple validated sources and check engagement levels (e.g., LinkedIn interactions) to confirm activity.  \\n   - Challenge: Potential duplicate leads.  \\n     - Solution: Maintain a systematic recording and real-time verification of each lead before adding it to the list.  \\n\\n4. **Use of Available Tools:**  \\n   - I will use the Serper tool to conduct direct searches and find leads specified in the search strategy (medical universities, doctor roles).  \\n   - I will employ systematic keyword variations and related searches to enhance the breadth and quality of potential leads.  \\n   - Execute multiple calls to find relevant individuals in specified roles across several sources such as LinkedIn and university directories.  \\n\\n5. **Expected Outcome:** The output will be a JSON array containing exactly 10 high-quality lead objects that include the name, email, company, title, and LinkedIn profile URL. This will perfectly align with the user's goals of identifying qualified prospects in medicine within US universities, ensuring all quality and relevance criteria are met.  \\n\\nI feel confident in the plan developed and the structured approach outlined.

MAINTAIN YOUR RUNNING LIST of leads to avoid duplicates and track progress accurately. \\\"\\n\\n\\nReasoning Plan:\\n1. **Understanding of the Task:** The goal is to generate exactly 10 high-quality leads that significantly align with the user's specified search strategy. The focus is on doctors in top medical universities in the USA with titles such as chief, professor, author, teacher, director, founder, and doctor, ensuring they are in decision-making or influential positions and that their profiles are complete and active.  \\n\\n2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**  \\n   - Initialize an empty lead list and define criteria for high-quality leads.  \\n   - Begin with a direct search using the user's provided strategy to extract potential leads.  \\n   - Evaluate each lead against the quality criteria: title, relevance, decision-making authority, completeness of profile, and engagement.  \\n   - Track and manage the list to ensure uniqueness, avoiding duplicates based on name and company combination.  \\n   - If the target of 10 leads is not met, utilize additional search strategies, including keyword variations, industry specifics, location bases, job titles, and companies.  \\n   - Repeat the search until I have exactly 10 unique qualified leads.  \\n   - After each search, report the progress of unique qualified leads found.  \\n\\n3. **Challenges and Solutions:**  \\n   - Challenge: Identifying high-quality leads could be hindered by incomplete profiles or inactive individuals.  \\n     - Solution: Use multiple validated sources and check engagement levels (e.g., LinkedIn interactions) to confirm activity.  \\n   - Challenge: Potential duplicate leads.  \\n     - Solution: Maintain a systematic recording and real-time verification of each lead before adding it to the list.  \\n\\n4. **Use of Available Tools:**  \\n   - I will use the Serper tool to conduct direct searches and find leads specified in the search strategy (medical universities, doctor roles).  \\n   - I will employ systematic keyword variations and related searches to enhance the breadth and quality of potential leads.  \\n   - Execute multiple calls to find relevant individuals in specified roles across several sources such as LinkedIn and university directories.  \\n\\n5. **Expected Outcome:** The output will be a JSON array containing exactly 10 high-quality lead objects that include the name, email, company, title, and LinkedIn profile URL. This will perfectly align with the user's goals of identifying qualified prospects in medicine within US universities, ensuring all quality and relevance criteria are met.  \\n\\nI feel confident in the plan developed and the structured approach outlined.

Direct Search: Use the exact search strategy provided by the user 2. Keyword Variations: Modify the search strategy with different keywords 3. Industry-Specific: Add industry terms to the search strategy 4. Location-Based: Add location terms to the search strategy 5. Job Title Focus: Add job title terms to the search strategy 6.

The leads should include titles such as doctor, CEO, president, founder, manager, director, chief, or officer, and should be decision-makers in their respective organizations. It is imperative to maintain a running list to avoid duplicates and ensure that all leads completely fulfill the quality criteria outlined.\\n\\n2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task**: \\n   - Initialize an empty list for tracking found leads. \\n   - Begin with the user's search strategy (focused on doctors in high-ranking institutions). \\n   - Conduct searches using different approaches: direct search, keyword variations, industry-specific terms, and focusing on job titles and companies.\\n   - For each lead obtained, evaluate them against the quality criteria and check for duplicates before adding them to the list.\\n   - Keep a running count of unique qualified leads and report the progress after each search.\\n\\n3. **Approaching Challenges**: Challenges may include the potential lack of leads that perfectly meet the criteria under certain approaches. To address this, I will implement a mix of all search approaches systematically to increase the chances of finding relevant leads while remaining flexible to pivot if one approach does not yield enough results. If necessary, additional targeted search criteria will be incorporated to refine results further.\\n\\n4. **Strategic Use of Available Tools**: The primary tool available is the internet search engine (Serper). I will leverage this tool in the following manner:  \\n   - Conduct direct searches for profiles relevant to the hierarchy specified (doctors and C-level executives) with location filters (top hospitals/universities in the US).  \\n   - Implement keyword variations to broaden the pool of prospects. \\n   - Utilize specific terms associated with hospitals/universities to generate leads from multiple sources (e.g., LinkedIn, hospital staff lists, university directories).\\n   - Retrieve as much information as possible from found links to maintain thorough records (including name, company, title, and potential LinkedIn profile).\\n   - Ensure all findings are tailored to maintain quality as per the criteria established by the user.\\n\\n5. **Expected Outcome**: The expected output is a JSON array of exactly 50 unique high-quality lead objects, each containing full name, email, company, title, and LinkedIn profile URL. The outcome will strongly align with the goal, fulfilling the user’s requirements for booking demos through correctly targeted leads while adhering strictly to the quality metrics mentioned.\\n\"}, \"context\": \"```\\nThought: I have identified more potential leads in healthcare leadership based on the latest search results.

Company Focus: Add company-specific terms to the search strategy\\nLEAD TRACKING AND DEDUPLICATION: - Maintain a running list of ALL leads found so far - Check each new lead against your existing list to avoid duplicates - Use name + company combination to identify unique leads - Only add leads that are not already in your list - Keep track of total unique leads found across all searches\\nEXECUTION PLAN: 1. Initialize an empty list to track all found leads 2. Start with the user's search strategy, extract leads, EVALUATE EACH LEAD for quality 3. For each lead found, check if it's already in your list (deduplicate) 4. Only add NEW, QUALIFIED leads that meet ALL quality criteria 5. Count only UNIQUE leads toward your target 6. If you haven't reached 10 QUALIFIED leads, try keyword variations 7. Continue through all approaches until you have exactly 10 high-quality leads 8. After each search, report: \\\"Found X UNIQUE QUALIFIED leads so far, need Y more\\\" 9. Do not stop until you have exactly 10 unique leads that meet quality standards\\nLEAD EVALUATION PROCESS: For each potential lead found: - Check if their title/role matches target clients - Verify their company is relevant to search strategy - Ensure they have decision-making authority - Confirm their profile is complete and professional - Check if this lead is already in your running list (deduplicate) - Only include if they meet ALL quality criteria AND are not duplicates\\nPROGRESS TRACKING: - Keep a running count of unique qualified leads - After each search, update your count and report progress - Example: \\\"Search 1: Found 5 new qualified leads. Total: 5/50\\\" - Example: \\\"Search 2: Found 3 new qualified leads. Total: 8/50\\\" - Continue until you reach exactly 10 unique qualified leads\\nOUTPUT FORMAT: Return a JSON array with exactly 10 HIGH-QUALITY lead objects, each containing: - name: Lead's full name - company: Company name - title: Job title - linkedin: LinkedIn profile URL (if available) - email: (leave empty, will be filled by email finder)\\nREMEMBER: Your target is 10 HIGH-QUALITY leads. Do not stop until you reach this number. Only include leads that STRONGLY MATCH your search criteria and meet all quality standards. MAINTAIN YOUR RUNNING LIST of leads to avoid duplicates and track progress accurately. \\\"\\n\\n\\nReasoning Plan:\\n1. **Understanding of the Task:** The goal is to generate exactly 10 high-quality leads that significantly align with the user's specified search strategy. The focus is on doctors in top medical universities in the USA with titles such as chief, professor, author, teacher, director, founder, and doctor, ensuring they are in decision-making or influential positions and that their profiles are complete and active.  \\n\\n2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**  \\n   - Initialize an empty lead list and define criteria for high-quality leads.  \\n   - Begin with a direct search using the user's provided strategy to extract potential leads.  \\n   - Evaluate each lead against the quality criteria: title, relevance, decision-making authority, completeness of profile, and engagement.  \\n   - Track and manage the list to ensure uniqueness, avoiding duplicates based on name and company combination.  \\n   - If the target of 10 leads is not met, utilize additional search strategies, including keyword variations, industry specifics, location bases, job titles, and companies.  \\n   - Repeat the search until I have exactly 10 unique qualified leads.  \\n   - After each search, report the progress of unique qualified leads found.  \\n\\n3. **Challenges and Solutions:**  \\n   - Challenge: Identifying high-quality leads could be hindered by incomplete profiles or inactive individuals.  \\n     - Solution: Use multiple validated sources and check engagement levels (e.g., LinkedIn interactions) to confirm activity.  \\n   - Challenge: Potential duplicate leads.  \\n     - Solution: Maintain a systematic recording and real-time verification of each lead before adding it to the list.  \\n\\n4. **Use of Available Tools:**  \\n   - I will use the Serper tool to conduct direct searches and find leads specified in the search strategy (medical universities, doctor roles).  \\n   - I will employ systematic keyword variations and related searches to enhance the breadth and quality of potential leads.  \\n   - Execute multiple calls to find relevant individuals in specified roles across several sources such as LinkedIn and university directories.  \\n\\n5. **Expected Outcome:** The output will be a JSON array containing exactly 10 high-quality lead objects that include the name, email, company, title, and LinkedIn profile URL. This will perfectly align with the user's goals of identifying qualified prospects in medicine within US universities, ensuring all quality and relevance criteria are met.  \\n\\nI feel confident in the plan developed and the structured approach outlined.

MAINTAIN YOUR RUNNING LIST of leads to avoid duplicates and track progress accurately. \\\"\\n\\n\\nReasoning Plan:\\n1. **Understanding of the Task:** The goal is to generate exactly 10 high-quality leads that significantly align with the user's specified search strategy. The focus is on doctors in top medical universities in the USA with titles such as chief, professor, author, teacher, director, founder, and doctor, ensuring they are in decision-making or influential positions and that their profiles are complete and active.  \\n\\n2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**  \\n   - Initialize an empty lead list and define criteria for high-quality leads.  \\n   - Begin with a direct search using the user's provided strategy to extract potential leads.  \\n   - Evaluate each lead against the quality criteria: title, relevance, decision-making authority, completeness of profile, and engagement.  \\n   - Track and manage the list to ensure uniqueness, avoiding duplicates based on name and company combination.  \\n   - If the target of 10 leads is not met, utilize additional search strategies, including keyword variations, industry specifics, location bases, job titles, and companies.  \\n   - Repeat the search until I have exactly 10 unique qualified leads.  \\n   - After each search, report the progress of unique qualified leads found.  \\n\\n3. **Challenges and Solutions:**  \\n   - Challenge: Identifying high-quality leads could be hindered by incomplete profiles or inactive individuals.  \\n     - Solution: Use multiple validated sources and check engagement levels (e.g., LinkedIn interactions) to confirm activity.  \\n   - Challenge: Potential duplicate leads.  \\n     - Solution: Maintain a systematic recording and real-time verification of each lead before adding it to the list.  \\n\\n4. **Use of Available Tools:**  \\n   - I will use the Serper tool to conduct direct searches and find leads specified in the search strategy (medical universities, doctor roles).  \\n   - I will employ systematic keyword variations and related searches to enhance the breadth and quality of potential leads.  \\n   - Execute multiple calls to find relevant individuals in specified roles across several sources such as LinkedIn and university directories.  \\n\\n5. **Expected Outcome:** The output will be a JSON array containing exactly 10 high-quality lead objects that include the name, email, company, title, and LinkedIn profile URL. This will perfectly align with the user's goals of identifying qualified prospects in medicine within US universities, ensuring all quality and relevance criteria are met.  \\n\\nI feel confident in the plan developed and the structured approach outlined.

The leads should include titles such as doctor, CEO, president, founder, manager, director, chief, or officer, and should be decision-makers in their respective organizations. It is imperative to maintain a running list to avoid duplicates and ensure that all leads completely fulfill the quality criteria outlined.\\n\\n2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task**: \\n   - Initialize an empty list for tracking found leads. \\n   - Begin with the user's search strategy (focused on doctors in high-ranking institutions). \\n   - Conduct searches using different approaches: direct search, keyword variations, industry-specific terms, and focusing on job titles and companies.\\n   - For each lead obtained, evaluate them against the quality criteria and check for duplicates before adding them to the list.\\n   - Keep a running count of unique qualified leads and report the progress after each search.\\n\\n3. **Approaching Challenges**: Challenges may include the potential lack of leads that perfectly meet the criteria under certain approaches. To address this, I will implement a mix of all search approaches systematically to increase the chances of finding relevant leads while remaining flexible to pivot if one approach does not yield enough results. If necessary, additional targeted search criteria will be incorporated to refine results further.\\n\\n4. **Strategic Use of Available Tools**: The primary tool available is the internet search engine (Serper). I will leverage this tool in the following manner:  \\n   - Conduct direct searches for profiles relevant to the hierarchy specified (doctors and C-level executives) with location filters (top hospitals/universities in the US).  \\n   - Implement keyword variations to broaden the pool of prospects. \\n   - Utilize specific terms associated with hospitals/universities to generate leads from multiple sources (e.g., LinkedIn, hospital staff lists, university directories).\\n   - Retrieve as much information as possible from found links to maintain thorough records (including name, company, title, and potential LinkedIn profile).\\n   - Ensure all findings are tailored to maintain quality as per the criteria established by the user.\\n\\n5. **Expected Outcome**: The expected output is a JSON array of exactly 50 unique high-quality lead objects, each containing full name, email, company, title, and LinkedIn profile URL. The outcome will strongly align with the goal, fulfilling the user’s requirements for booking demos through correctly targeted leads while adhering strictly to the quality metrics mentioned.\\n\"}, \"context\": \"```\\nThought: I have identified more potential leads in healthcare leadership based on the latest search results.

Focus ONLY on prospects that are PERFECTLY RELEVANT to the user's search strategy and target audience.\\nUser Input: Search Strategy: doctors working in top medical universities in USA Target Clients: ['cheif', 'professor', 'author', 'teacher', 'director', 'founder', 'doctor'] Campaign Agenda: demo Maximum Leads: 10 (THIS IS YOUR TARGET - DO NOT STOP UNTIL YOU REACH THIS NUMBER) Search Depth: 3\\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS: - You MUST generate exactly 10 leads - ONLY include leads that STRONGLY MATCH your search criteria - Each lead must be HIGHLY RELEVANT to the user's search strategy - Do not stop until you have exactly 10 high-quality leads - Track your progress and report how many QUALIFIED leads you have found - Use the search strategy provided by the user - Use multiple search approaches to reach the target - MAINTAIN A RUNNING LIST of all found leads to avoid duplicates\\nQUALITY CRITERIA FOR VALID LEADS: - Lead's role/title must DIRECTLY MATCH the target clients specified - Lead's company/industry must be RELEVANT to the search strategy - Lead must be in a DECISION-MAKING or INFLUENTIAL position - Lead must have a COMPLETE profile with name, company, and title - Lead must be ACTIVE and ENGAGED in their professional role - Lead's background must ALIGN with the campaign agenda\\nSEARCH APPROACHES (Use these systematically with the user's search strategy): 1. Direct Search: Use the exact search strategy provided by the user 2. Keyword Variations: Modify the search strategy with different keywords 3. Industry-Specific: Add industry terms to the search strategy 4. Location-Based: Add location terms to the search strategy 5. Job Title Focus: Add job title terms to the search strategy 6. Company Focus: Add company-specific terms to the search strategy\\nLEAD TRACKING AND DEDUPLICATION: - Maintain a running list of ALL leads found so far - Check each new lead against your existing list to avoid duplicates - Use name + company combination to identify unique leads - Only add leads that are not already in your list - Keep track of total unique leads found across all searches\\nEXECUTION PLAN: 1. Initialize an empty list to track all found leads 2. Start with the user's search strategy, extract leads, EVALUATE EACH LEAD for quality 3. For each lead found, check if it's already in your list (deduplicate) 4. Only add NEW, QUALIFIED leads that meet ALL quality criteria 5. Count only UNIQUE leads toward your target 6. If you haven't reached 10 QUALIFIED leads, try keyword variations 7. Continue through all approaches until you have exactly 10 high-quality leads 8. After each search, report: \\\"Found X UNIQUE QUALIFIED leads so far, need Y more\\\" 9. Do not stop until you have exactly 10 unique leads that meet quality standards\\nLEAD EVALUATION PROCESS: For each potential lead found: - Check if their title/role matches target clients - Verify their company is relevant to search strategy - Ensure they have decision-making authority - Confirm their profile is complete and professional - Check if this lead is already in your running list (deduplicate) - Only include if they meet ALL quality criteria AND are not duplicates\\nPROGRESS TRACKING: - Keep a running count of unique qualified leads - After each search, update your count and report progress - Example: \\\"Search 1: Found 5 new qualified leads. Total: 5/50\\\" - Example: \\\"Search 2: Found 3 new qualified leads. Total: 8/50\\\" - Continue until you reach exactly 10 unique qualified leads\\nOUTPUT FORMAT: Return a JSON array with exactly 10 HIGH-QUALITY lead objects, each containing: - name: Lead's full name - company: Company name - title: Job title - linkedin: LinkedIn profile URL (if available) - email: (leave empty, will be filled by email finder)\\nREMEMBER: Your target is 10 HIGH-QUALITY leads. Do not stop until you reach this number. Only include leads that STRONGLY MATCH your search criteria and meet all quality standards. MAINTAIN YOUR RUNNING LIST of leads to avoid duplicates and track progress accurately. \\\"\\n\\n\\nReasoning Plan:\\n1. **Understanding of the Task:** The goal is to generate exactly 10 high-quality leads that significantly align with the user's specified search strategy. The focus is on doctors in top medical universities in the USA with titles such as chief, professor, author, teacher, director, founder, and doctor, ensuring they are in decision-making or influential positions and that their profiles are complete and active.  \\n\\n2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**  \\n   - Initialize an empty lead list and define criteria for high-quality leads.  \\n   - Begin with a direct search using the user's provided strategy to extract potential leads.  \\n   - Evaluate each lead against the quality criteria: title, relevance, decision-making authority, completeness of profile, and engagement.  \\n   - Track and manage the list to ensure uniqueness, avoiding duplicates based on name and company combination.  \\n   - If the target of 10 leads is not met, utilize additional search strategies, including keyword variations, industry specifics, location bases, job titles, and companies.  \\n   - Repeat the search until I have exactly 10 unique qualified leads.  \\n   - After each search, report the progress of unique qualified leads found.  \\n\\n3. **Challenges and Solutions:**  \\n   - Challenge: Identifying high-quality leads could be hindered by incomplete profiles or inactive individuals.  \\n     - Solution: Use multiple validated sources and check engagement levels (e.g., LinkedIn interactions) to confirm activity.  \\n   - Challenge: Potential duplicate leads.  \\n     - Solution: Maintain a systematic recording and real-time verification of each lead before adding it to the list.  \\n\\n4. **Use of Available Tools:**  \\n   - I will use the Serper tool to conduct direct searches and find leads specified in the search strategy (medical universities, doctor roles).  \\n   - I will employ systematic keyword variations and related searches to enhance the breadth and quality of potential leads.  \\n   - Execute multiple calls to find relevant individuals in specified roles across several sources such as LinkedIn and university directories.  \\n\\n5. **Expected Outcome:** The output will be a JSON array containing exactly 10 high-quality lead objects that include the name, email, company, title, and LinkedIn profile URL. This will perfectly align with the user's goals of identifying qualified prospects in medicine within US universities, ensuring all quality and relevance criteria are met.  \\n\\nI feel confident in the plan developed and the structured approach outlined.

Focus ONLY on prospects that are PERFECTLY RELEVANT to the user's search strategy and target audience.\\nUser Input: Search Strategy: doctors working in top medical universities in USA Target Clients: ['cheif', 'professor', 'author', 'teacher', 'director', 'founder', 'doctor'] Campaign Agenda: demo Maximum Leads: 10 (THIS IS YOUR TARGET - DO NOT STOP UNTIL YOU REACH THIS NUMBER) Search Depth: 3\\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS: - You MUST generate exactly 10 leads - ONLY include leads that STRONGLY MATCH your search criteria - Each lead must be HIGHLY RELEVANT to the user's search strategy - Do not stop until you have exactly 10 high-quality leads - Track your progress and report how many QUALIFIED leads you have found - Use the search strategy provided by the user - Use multiple search approaches to reach the target - MAINTAIN A RUNNING LIST of all found leads to avoid duplicates\\nQUALITY CRITERIA FOR VALID LEADS: - Lead's role/title must DIRECTLY MATCH the target clients specified - Lead's company/industry must be RELEVANT to the search strategy - Lead must be in a DECISION-MAKING or INFLUENTIAL position - Lead must have a COMPLETE profile with name, company, and title - Lead must be ACTIVE and ENGAGED in their professional role - Lead's background must ALIGN with the campaign agenda\\nSEARCH APPROACHES (Use these systematically with the user's search strategy): 1. Direct Search: Use the exact search strategy provided by the user 2. Keyword Variations: Modify the search strategy with different keywords 3. Industry-Specific: Add industry terms to the search strategy 4. Location-Based: Add location terms to the search strategy 5. Job Title Focus: Add job title terms to the search strategy 6. Company Focus: Add company-specific terms to the search strategy\\nLEAD TRACKING AND DEDUPLICATION: - Maintain a running list of ALL leads found so far - Check each new lead against your existing list to avoid duplicates - Use name + company combination to identify unique leads - Only add leads that are not already in your list - Keep track of total unique leads found across all searches\\nEXECUTION PLAN: 1. Initialize an empty list to track all found leads 2. Start with the user's search strategy, extract leads, EVALUATE EACH LEAD for quality 3. For each lead found, check if it's already in your list (deduplicate) 4. Only add NEW, QUALIFIED leads that meet ALL quality criteria 5. Count only UNIQUE leads toward your target 6. If you haven't reached 10 QUALIFIED leads, try keyword variations 7. Continue through all approaches until you have exactly 10 high-quality leads 8. After each search, report: \\\"Found X UNIQUE QUALIFIED leads so far, need Y more\\\" 9. Do not stop until you have exactly 10 unique leads that meet quality standards\\nLEAD EVALUATION PROCESS: For each potential lead found: - Check if their title/role matches target clients - Verify their company is relevant to search strategy - Ensure they have decision-making authority - Confirm their profile is complete and professional - Check if this lead is already in your running list (deduplicate) - Only include if they meet ALL quality criteria AND are not duplicates\\nPROGRESS TRACKING: - Keep a running count of unique qualified leads - After each search, update your count and report progress - Example: \\\"Search 1: Found 5 new qualified leads. Total: 5/50\\\" - Example: \\\"Search 2: Found 3 new qualified leads. Total: 8/50\\\" - Continue until you reach exactly 10 unique qualified leads\\nOUTPUT FORMAT: Return a JSON array with exactly 10 HIGH-QUALITY lead objects, each containing: - name: Lead's full name - company: Company name - title: Job title - linkedin: LinkedIn profile URL (if available) - email: (leave empty, will be filled by email finder)\\nREMEMBER: Your target is 10 HIGH-QUALITY leads. Do not stop until you reach this number. Only include leads that STRONGLY MATCH your search criteria and meet all quality standards. MAINTAIN YOUR RUNNING LIST of leads to avoid duplicates and track progress accurately. \\\"\\n\\n\\nReasoning Plan:\\n1. **Understanding of the Task:** The goal is to generate exactly 10 high-quality leads that significantly align with the user's specified search strategy. The focus is on doctors in top medical universities in the USA with titles such as chief, professor, author, teacher, director, founder, and doctor, ensuring they are in decision-making or influential positions and that their profiles are complete and active.  \\n\\n2. **Key Steps to Complete the Task:**  \\n   - Initialize an empty lead list and define criteria for high-quality leads.  \\n   - Begin with a direct search using the user's provided strategy to extract potential leads.  \\n   - Evaluate each lead against the quality criteria: title, relevance, decision-making authority, completeness of profile, and engagement.  \\n   - Track and manage the list to ensure uniqueness, avoiding duplicates based on name and company combination.  \\n   - If the target of 10 leads is not met, utilize additional search strategies, including keyword variations, industry specifics, location bases, job titles, and companies.  \\n   - Repeat the search until I have exactly 10 unique qualified leads.  \\n   - After each search, report the progress of unique qualified leads found.  \\n\\n3. **Challenges and Solutions:**  \\n   - Challenge: Identifying high-quality leads could be hindered by incomplete profiles or inactive individuals.  \\n     - Solution: Use multiple validated sources and check engagement levels (e.g., LinkedIn interactions) to confirm activity.  \\n   - Challenge: Potential duplicate leads.  \\n     - Solution: Maintain a systematic recording and real-time verification of each lead before adding it to the list.  \\n\\n4. **Use of Available Tools:**  \\n   - I will use the Serper tool to conduct direct searches and find leads specified in the search strategy (medical universities, doctor roles).  \\n   - I will employ systematic keyword variations and related searches to enhance the breadth and quality of potential leads.  \\n   - Execute multiple calls to find relevant individuals in specified roles across several sources such as LinkedIn and university directories.  \\n\\n5. **Expected Outcome:** The output will be a JSON array containing exactly 10 high-quality lead objects that include the name, email, company, title, and LinkedIn profile URL. This will perfectly align with the user's goals of identifying qualified prospects in medicine within US universities, ensuring all quality and relevance criteria are met.  \\n\\nI feel confident in the plan developed and the structured approach outlined. I am now ready to utilize the SERPER tool for this task.  \\n\"}, \"context\": \"```\\nThought: I have found more potential leads from the latest search results, which include some esteemed professionals in top US medical universities.
