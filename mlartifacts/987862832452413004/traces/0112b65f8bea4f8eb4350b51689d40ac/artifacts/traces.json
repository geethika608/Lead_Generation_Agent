The plan will include generating industry-specific keywords, identifying relevant target company attributes, and devising effective LinkedIn search strategies that focus solely on LinkedIn's platform. My approach begins with understanding the user's business domain, target clients, campaign goals, maximum leads, and search depth. Based on this information, I will leverage my expertise to identify pertinent LinkedIn keywords, filter criteria for companies, and effective search tactics.

Studies show that 89% of B2B marketers utilize LinkedIn’s robust marketing tools and features to drive effective lead gen . Compared to other social networks, LinkedIn provides unmatched targeting capabilities and access to high-value decision-makers, making it the ideal platform to identify, engage, and convert relevant prospects for your software offerings.\\nOn top of that, LinkedIn (in my opinion) is the ONE platform where B2B buyers actually log on open and willing to be influenced on B2B buying decisions.\\nSavvy professionals and entrepreneurs log in to see what's trending in the world, what peers are doing, what tech is being used, what marketing trends are taking off etc. This makes it a truly unique and powerful weapon when you know what you're doing.\\nIn this guide, we’ll cover everything you need to know to maximize LinkedIn for generating quality software leads, from defining your target audience and optimizing your company presence to proven LinkedIn lead gen tactics and conversion strategies. We can also share top-performing LinkedIn ads for software companies with you.\\nTable of contents\\nDefining Your Target Audience is the Critical First Step\\nOptimizing Your LinkedIn Profile for LinkedIn Lead Gen\\nDeveloping a LinkedIn Content Strategy\\nLeveraging LinkedIn Ads to Drive Leads\\nContinually Optimize Based on Performance\\nNurturing and Converting Leads\\nDefining Your Target Audience is the Critical First Step\\nThe very first step to generating leads on LinkedIn is identifying who you want to target with LinkedIn Ads . The most effective approach is to focus your efforts on prospects that will gain the most value from your software solutions and, in return, provide the highest lifetime value to your business.\\nLinkedIn’s advanced filters and demographics allow you to precisely target your ideal customer profile (ICP) based on:\\nIndustry – Target prospects in your specific software niche, whether it’s marketing, sales, HR, design, etc.\\nCompany Size – Prioritize leads from small, mid-market, or enterprise companies.\\nJob Titles & Seniority – Target key decision-makers like VPs, directors, and managers.\\nGeographic Location – Focus on prospects in your ideal markets or territories.\\nFor even more refined targeting , LinkedIn Sales Navigator provides robust search features to find your best-fit accounts and contacts. You can create advanced Boolean searches combining multiple filters and keywords. For larger lead gen initiatives, consider teaming up with a LinkedIn ads agency that can tap into additional expertise to help identify and scale your efforts towards your highest-value prospects.\\nTaking the time upfront to clearly define your ICP will ensure your LinkedIn efforts are focused on the accounts and contacts that align best with your target customer profile.\\nHere is a great article on \\\"Is Sales Navigator Worth it?\\\"\\nOptimizing Your LinkedIn Profile for LinkedIn Lead Gen\\nWith 93% of recruiters reviewing LinkedIn profiles before engaging, having an optimized company presence is critical for lead gen.\\nRelated Article on Optimizing LinkedIn Personal Profile\\n1. LinkedIn Profile Photo & Branding Make a Strong First Impression\\nYour profile photo and background image are the first touchpoints prospects have with your brand on LinkedIn. Add a professional headshot of yourself or other executives and customize your background with your logo, mission statement, or relevant call-to-action. Your headline is valuable real estate – include target keywords that will resonate with your audience.\\nThink of your profile as a landing page that needs optimization if ICP quality traffic is hitting it.\\n2. LinkedIn Company Description Highlights Your Differentiators\\nYour company description is your chance to highlight what makes your software offering unique. Cover your origin story, passion areas, competitive differentiators, breadth of expertise, and range of offerings. Be sure to directly invite visitors to learn more or connect while providing clear contact info to drive engagement.\\nOne thing we've seen be true over and over again is that visiting someone's LinkedIn company page seems to be a key pit stop of many buyers during the consideration phase. It can be pretty critical to ensure you have at least the foundations in place here and, ideally, some content activity and engagement, if possible, to make it look like you're alive and kicking.\\nFollow LinkedIn Company Page Best Practices\\n3. Showcase Achievements to Demonstrate Credibility\\nDisplaying your company’s thought leadership, achievements, and customer traction builds credibility with prospects. Highlight company culture, awards won, important milestones, total customers, impressive customer logos, and advocacy in the form of customer testimonials. Social proof like client success stories and reviews powerfully showcase the results you deliver.\\n4.

Studies show that 89% of B2B marketers utilize LinkedIn’s robust marketing tools and features to drive effective lead gen . Compared to other social networks, LinkedIn provides unmatched targeting capabilities and access to high-value decision-makers, making it the ideal platform to identify, engage, and convert relevant prospects for your software offerings.\\nOn top of that, LinkedIn (in my opinion) is the ONE platform where B2B buyers actually log on open and willing to be influenced on B2B buying decisions.\\nSavvy professionals and entrepreneurs log in to see what's trending in the world, what peers are doing, what tech is being used, what marketing trends are taking off etc. This makes it a truly unique and powerful weapon when you know what you're doing.\\nIn this guide, we’ll cover everything you need to know to maximize LinkedIn for generating quality software leads, from defining your target audience and optimizing your company presence to proven LinkedIn lead gen tactics and conversion strategies.

You can create advanced Boolean searches combining multiple filters and keywords. For larger lead gen initiatives, consider teaming up with a LinkedIn ads agency that can tap into additional expertise to help identify and scale your efforts towards your highest-value prospects.\\nTaking the time upfront to clearly define your ICP will ensure your LinkedIn efforts are focused on the accounts and contacts that align best with your target customer profile.\\nHere is a great article on \\\"Is Sales Navigator Worth it?\\\"\\nOptimizing Your LinkedIn Profile for LinkedIn Lead Gen\\nWith 93% of recruiters reviewing LinkedIn profiles before engaging, having an optimized company presence is critical for lead gen.\\nRelated Article on Optimizing LinkedIn Personal Profile\\n1.

Social proof like client success stories and reviews powerfully showcase the results you deliver.\\n4. Build Your LinkedIn Network to Stay Top of Mind\\nProactively connecting and engaging with prospective clients, partners, and industry influencers provides a valuable feed of relevant insights. When influencers share content in your niche, like, comment, share, and post it yourself to establish your expertise. This keeps your brand top of mind while nurturing relationships.\\nGreat article here about the Pros and Cons of leveraging LinkedIn Automation Tools for this part of the strategy.\\nDeveloping a LinkedIn Content Strategy\\nSharing relevant, valuable content with your network generates 5x more profile views while keeping you top of mind with your audience.

Studies show that 89% of B2B marketers utilize LinkedIn’s robust marketing tools and features to drive effective lead gen . Compared to other social networks, LinkedIn provides unmatched targeting capabilities and access to high-value decision-makers, making it the ideal platform to identify, engage, and convert relevant prospects for your software offerings.\\nOn top of that, LinkedIn (in my opinion) is the ONE platform where B2B buyers actually log on open and willing to be influenced on B2B buying decisions.\\nSavvy professionals and entrepreneurs log in to see what's trending in the world, what peers are doing, what tech is being used, what marketing trends are taking off etc. This makes it a truly unique and powerful weapon when you know what you're doing.\\nIn this guide, we’ll cover everything you need to know to maximize LinkedIn for generating quality software leads, from defining your target audience and optimizing your company presence to proven LinkedIn lead gen tactics and conversion strategies. We can also share top-performing LinkedIn ads for software companies with you.\\nTable of contents\\nDefining Your Target Audience is the Critical First Step\\nOptimizing Your LinkedIn Profile for LinkedIn Lead Gen\\nDeveloping a LinkedIn Content Strategy\\nLeveraging LinkedIn Ads to Drive Leads\\nContinually Optimize Based on Performance\\nNurturing and Converting Leads\\nDefining Your Target Audience is the Critical First Step\\nThe very first step to generating leads on LinkedIn is identifying who you want to target with LinkedIn Ads . The most effective approach is to focus your efforts on prospects that will gain the most value from your software solutions and, in return, provide the highest lifetime value to your business.\\nLinkedIn’s advanced filters and demographics allow you to precisely target your ideal customer profile (ICP) based on:\\nIndustry – Target prospects in your specific software niche, whether it’s marketing, sales, HR, design, etc.\\nCompany Size – Prioritize leads from small, mid-market, or enterprise companies.\\nJob Titles & Seniority – Target key decision-makers like VPs, directors, and managers.\\nGeographic Location – Focus on prospects in your ideal markets or territories.\\nFor even more refined targeting , LinkedIn Sales Navigator provides robust search features to find your best-fit accounts and contacts. You can create advanced Boolean searches combining multiple filters and keywords. For larger lead gen initiatives, consider teaming up with a LinkedIn ads agency that can tap into additional expertise to help identify and scale your efforts towards your highest-value prospects.\\nTaking the time upfront to clearly define your ICP will ensure your LinkedIn efforts are focused on the accounts and contacts that align best with your target customer profile.\\nHere is a great article on \\\"Is Sales Navigator Worth it?\\\"\\nOptimizing Your LinkedIn Profile for LinkedIn Lead Gen\\nWith 93% of recruiters reviewing LinkedIn profiles before engaging, having an optimized company presence is critical for lead gen.\\nRelated Article on Optimizing LinkedIn Personal Profile\\n1. LinkedIn Profile Photo & Branding Make a Strong First Impression\\nYour profile photo and background image are the first touchpoints prospects have with your brand on LinkedIn. Add a professional headshot of yourself or other executives and customize your background with your logo, mission statement, or relevant call-to-action. Your headline is valuable real estate – include target keywords that will resonate with your audience.\\nThink of your profile as a landing page that needs optimization if ICP quality traffic is hitting it.\\n2. LinkedIn Company Description Highlights Your Differentiators\\nYour company description is your chance to highlight what makes your software offering unique. Cover your origin story, passion areas, competitive differentiators, breadth of expertise, and range of offerings. Be sure to directly invite visitors to learn more or connect while providing clear contact info to drive engagement.\\nOne thing we've seen be true over and over again is that visiting someone's LinkedIn company page seems to be a key pit stop of many buyers during the consideration phase. It can be pretty critical to ensure you have at least the foundations in place here and, ideally, some content activity and engagement, if possible, to make it look like you're alive and kicking.\\nFollow LinkedIn Company Page Best Practices\\n3. Showcase Achievements to Demonstrate Credibility\\nDisplaying your company’s thought leadership, achievements, and customer traction builds credibility with prospects. Highlight company culture, awards won, important milestones, total customers, impressive customer logos, and advocacy in the form of customer testimonials. Social proof like client success stories and reviews powerfully showcase the results you deliver.\\n4. Build Your LinkedIn Network to Stay Top of Mind\\nProactively connecting and engaging with prospective clients, partners, and industry influencers provides a valuable feed of relevant insights. When influencers share content in your niche, like, comment, share, and post it yourself to establish your expertise. This keeps your brand top of mind while nurturing relationships.\\nGreat article here about the Pros and Cons of leveraging LinkedIn Automation Tools for this part of the strategy.\\nDeveloping a LinkedIn Content Strategy\\nSharing relevant, valuable content with your network generates 5x more profile views while keeping you top of mind with your audience.

Studies show that 89% of B2B marketers utilize LinkedIn’s robust marketing tools and features to drive effective lead gen . Compared to other social networks, LinkedIn provides unmatched targeting capabilities and access to high-value decision-makers, making it the ideal platform to identify, engage, and convert relevant prospects for your software offerings.\\nOn top of that, LinkedIn (in my opinion) is the ONE platform where B2B buyers actually log on open and willing to be influenced on B2B buying decisions.\\nSavvy professionals and entrepreneurs log in to see what's trending in the world, what peers are doing, what tech is being used, what marketing trends are taking off etc. This makes it a truly unique and powerful weapon when you know what you're doing.\\nIn this guide, we’ll cover everything you need to know to maximize LinkedIn for generating quality software leads, from defining your target audience and optimizing your company presence to proven LinkedIn lead gen tactics and conversion strategies. We can also share top-performing LinkedIn ads for software companies with you.\\nTable of contents\\nDefining Your Target Audience is the Critical First Step\\nOptimizing Your LinkedIn Profile for LinkedIn Lead Gen\\nDeveloping a LinkedIn Content Strategy\\nLeveraging LinkedIn Ads to Drive Leads\\nContinually Optimize Based on Performance\\nNurturing and Converting Leads\\nDefining Your Target Audience is the Critical First Step\\nThe very first step to generating leads on LinkedIn is identifying who you want to target with LinkedIn Ads . The most effective approach is to focus your efforts on prospects that will gain the most value from your software solutions and, in return, provide the highest lifetime value to your business.\\nLinkedIn’s advanced filters and demographics allow you to precisely target your ideal customer profile (ICP) based on:\\nIndustry – Target prospects in your specific software niche, whether it’s marketing, sales, HR, design, etc.\\nCompany Size – Prioritize leads from small, mid-market, or enterprise companies.\\nJob Titles & Seniority – Target key decision-makers like VPs, directors, and managers.\\nGeographic Location – Focus on prospects in your ideal markets or territories.\\nFor even more refined targeting , LinkedIn Sales Navigator provides robust search features to find your best-fit accounts and contacts. You can create advanced Boolean searches combining multiple filters and keywords. For larger lead gen initiatives, consider teaming up with a LinkedIn ads agency that can tap into additional expertise to help identify and scale your efforts towards your highest-value prospects.\\nTaking the time upfront to clearly define your ICP will ensure your LinkedIn efforts are focused on the accounts and contacts that align best with your target customer profile.\\nHere is a great article on \\\"Is Sales Navigator Worth it?\\\"\\nOptimizing Your LinkedIn Profile for LinkedIn Lead Gen\\nWith 93% of recruiters reviewing LinkedIn profiles before engaging, having an optimized company presence is critical for lead gen.\\nRelated Article on Optimizing LinkedIn Personal Profile\\n1. LinkedIn Profile Photo & Branding Make a Strong First Impression\\nYour profile photo and background image are the first touchpoints prospects have with your brand on LinkedIn. Add a professional headshot of yourself or other executives and customize your background with your logo, mission statement, or relevant call-to-action. Your headline is valuable real estate – include target keywords that will resonate with your audience.\\nThink of your profile as a landing page that needs optimization if ICP quality traffic is hitting it.\\n2. LinkedIn Company Description Highlights Your Differentiators\\nYour company description is your chance to highlight what makes your software offering unique. Cover your origin story, passion areas, competitive differentiators, breadth of expertise, and range of offerings. Be sure to directly invite visitors to learn more or connect while providing clear contact info to drive engagement.\\nOne thing we've seen be true over and over again is that visiting someone's LinkedIn company page seems to be a key pit stop of many buyers during the consideration phase. It can be pretty critical to ensure you have at least the foundations in place here and, ideally, some content activity and engagement, if possible, to make it look like you're alive and kicking.\\nFollow LinkedIn Company Page Best Practices\\n3. Showcase Achievements to Demonstrate Credibility\\nDisplaying your company’s thought leadership, achievements, and customer traction builds credibility with prospects. Highlight company culture, awards won, important milestones, total customers, impressive customer logos, and advocacy in the form of customer testimonials. Social proof like client success stories and reviews powerfully showcase the results you deliver.\\n4. Build Your LinkedIn Network to Stay Top of Mind\\nProactively connecting and engaging with prospective clients, partners, and industry influencers provides a valuable feed of relevant insights. When influencers share content in your niche, like, comment, share, and post it yourself to establish your expertise. This keeps your brand top of mind while nurturing relationships.\\nGreat article here about the Pros and Cons of leveraging LinkedIn Automation Tools for this part of the strategy.\\nDeveloping a LinkedIn Content Strategy\\nSharing relevant, valuable content with your network generates 5x more profile views while keeping you top of mind with your audience. But it’s critical the content be targeted and niche – broad content fails to attract your ideal prospects.\\nRecommended by LinkedIn\\nThe Ultimate 5-Step Guide to Unstoppable Lead…\\nPatrick Simone\\n1 year ago\\nHow to generate inbound leads from LinkedIn?\\nShraddha Shrivastava\\n1 year ago\\nMastering LinkedIn Lead Generation in 2025\\nYasmin Nasr Sayed (صاحبة السعادة بلينكدان)\\n5 months ago\\nLearn how to build a content strategy for LinkedIn in 10 easy steps .\\nWe are a big fan of thought-leadership style content for this which works especially well when amplified and scaled through paid ads and ad types like LinkedIn's Thought-Leader Ads format.\\n1.

Studies show that 89% of B2B marketers utilize LinkedIn’s robust marketing tools and features to drive effective lead gen . Compared to other social networks, LinkedIn provides unmatched targeting capabilities and access to high-value decision-makers, making it the ideal platform to identify, engage, and convert relevant prospects for your software offerings.\\nOn top of that, LinkedIn (in my opinion) is the ONE platform where B2B buyers actually log on open and willing to be influenced on B2B buying decisions.\\nSavvy professionals and entrepreneurs log in to see what's trending in the world, what peers are doing, what tech is being used, what marketing trends are taking off etc. This makes it a truly unique and powerful weapon when you know what you're doing.\\nIn this guide, we’ll cover everything you need to know to maximize LinkedIn for generating quality software leads, from defining your target audience and optimizing your company presence to proven LinkedIn lead gen tactics and conversion strategies. We can also share top-performing LinkedIn ads for software companies with you.\\nTable of contents\\nDefining Your Target Audience is the Critical First Step\\nOptimizing Your LinkedIn Profile for LinkedIn Lead Gen\\nDeveloping a LinkedIn Content Strategy\\nLeveraging LinkedIn Ads to Drive Leads\\nContinually Optimize Based on Performance\\nNurturing and Converting Leads\\nDefining Your Target Audience is the Critical First Step\\nThe very first step to generating leads on LinkedIn is identifying who you want to target with LinkedIn Ads . The most effective approach is to focus your efforts on prospects that will gain the most value from your software solutions and, in return, provide the highest lifetime value to your business.\\nLinkedIn’s advanced filters and demographics allow you to precisely target your ideal customer profile (ICP) based on:\\nIndustry – Target prospects in your specific software niche, whether it’s marketing, sales, HR, design, etc.\\nCompany Size – Prioritize leads from small, mid-market, or enterprise companies.\\nJob Titles & Seniority – Target key decision-makers like VPs, directors, and managers.\\nGeographic Location – Focus on prospects in your ideal markets or territories.\\nFor even more refined targeting , LinkedIn Sales Navigator provides robust search features to find your best-fit accounts and contacts. You can create advanced Boolean searches combining multiple filters and keywords. For larger lead gen initiatives, consider teaming up with a LinkedIn ads agency that can tap into additional expertise to help identify and scale your efforts towards your highest-value prospects.\\nTaking the time upfront to clearly define your ICP will ensure your LinkedIn efforts are focused on the accounts and contacts that align best with your target customer profile.\\nHere is a great article on \\\"Is Sales Navigator Worth it?\\\"\\nOptimizing Your LinkedIn Profile for LinkedIn Lead Gen\\nWith 93% of recruiters reviewing LinkedIn profiles before engaging, having an optimized company presence is critical for lead gen.\\nRelated Article on Optimizing LinkedIn Personal Profile\\n1. LinkedIn Profile Photo & Branding Make a Strong First Impression\\nYour profile photo and background image are the first touchpoints prospects have with your brand on LinkedIn. Add a professional headshot of yourself or other executives and customize your background with your logo, mission statement, or relevant call-to-action. Your headline is valuable real estate – include target keywords that will resonate with your audience.\\nThink of your profile as a landing page that needs optimization if ICP quality traffic is hitting it.\\n2. LinkedIn Company Description Highlights Your Differentiators\\nYour company description is your chance to highlight what makes your software offering unique. Cover your origin story, passion areas, competitive differentiators, breadth of expertise, and range of offerings. Be sure to directly invite visitors to learn more or connect while providing clear contact info to drive engagement.\\nOne thing we've seen be true over and over again is that visiting someone's LinkedIn company page seems to be a key pit stop of many buyers during the consideration phase. It can be pretty critical to ensure you have at least the foundations in place here and, ideally, some content activity and engagement, if possible, to make it look like you're alive and kicking.\\nFollow LinkedIn Company Page Best Practices\\n3. Showcase Achievements to Demonstrate Credibility\\nDisplaying your company’s thought leadership, achievements, and customer traction builds credibility with prospects. Highlight company culture, awards won, important milestones, total customers, impressive customer logos, and advocacy in the form of customer testimonials. Social proof like client success stories and reviews powerfully showcase the results you deliver.\\n4. Build Your LinkedIn Network to Stay Top of Mind\\nProactively connecting and engaging with prospective clients, partners, and industry influencers provides a valuable feed of relevant insights. When influencers share content in your niche, like, comment, share, and post it yourself to establish your expertise. This keeps your brand top of mind while nurturing relationships.\\nGreat article here about the Pros and Cons of leveraging LinkedIn Automation Tools for this part of the strategy.\\nDeveloping a LinkedIn Content Strategy\\nSharing relevant, valuable content with your network generates 5x more profile views while keeping you top of mind with your audience.

I love that I have had the opportunity to work with some fantastic people in the US teams. The hybrid work environment that Presidio promotes is also a huge bonus in working here.\\nWhat is the culture like at Presidio?\\nI think Presidio has a really good culture of inclusivity and celebrating the diversity of the organization. As an Irish person, I love that we can learn about Black history and celebrate cultural events like Diwali through the company, for example. I really enjoy watching the Town Halls and company-wide presentations – especially when you get to see how people from different parts of the world work and operate.\\nDo you have any advice for women looking to get into the tech industry?\\nI would say try it out and see what suits you. My skills lie more on the admin and organizational side, but I found my place within a very technical group despite not being technical. I think a lot of women are put off technical roles because they think it’s going to involve a heavy physical element, but IT has changed a lot since I came into the industry in 2014 and there are a lot of roles and areas that don’t involve that kind of work anymore. I think the hybrid aspect of Presidio should be celebrated especially in an environment where a lot of companies are trying to get people back in the office full-time. That is a particularly good selling point.\\nWhat woman in your life inspires you? Why?\\nI am always inspired by ALL people who have overcome major odds to achieve things in life. My aunt Rose is one of those people. As a teenager she had epilepsy and had a fit one evening while sitting by a fire. She burned most of her left hand – she lost all her fingers and most of her thumb in the accident and had to spent months in a hospital in Dublin in the early 1960’s having painful skin grafts. Despite all that, she still made a very successful life as a wife, mother of 3 children and spent most of her life working in some shape or form – shop work, childminder and then a credit controller which she still does now, at 71 years of age!\\nShe never ever let the loss of her hand hold her back. She was my mother’s only sister, and we lost my mother when she was 44 (I was 18) so my aunt really became almost like a mother figure to me and we still have that bond, 35 years on.\\nX\\nMeet Joelle T.\\nSingapore\\nWhat is your favorite part of your role here at Presidio?\\nI work in Presidio Singapore, overseeing global customers. This May 2025 marks my fifth year with Presidio, and it has been an incredible journey of growth and learning. Throughout my role, I’ve had the privilege of working alongside colleagues, customers, and suppliers, all of whom have significantly contributed to my professional and personal development. My favorite part of working in my role is making those connections.\\nWhat is the culture like at Presidio?\\nI highly value the culture at Presidio which fosters a sense of belonging. One of which I believe is the most important is our focus on mental health. Mental Health is vital in maintaining a healthy and balanced work environment in the company. It is so important that we even have a Mental Health Day as an initiative to promote this value.\\nDo you have any advice for women looking to get into the tech industry?\\nTo fellow women whom aspires to break into the Tech industry – More and more women are making an impact in the industries.

How can I help out my business better?\\nWhat is Presidio’s culture like?\\nThe people are very important here – our people drive our business.

Developing friendships, and learning about new technologies is also a huge reason I stay at Presidio. Many businesses don’t necessarily develop the latest technologies because they have budgets to consider and existing business to run. At Presidio, you learn the latest technologies as soon as they’re available, and you can then apply them to other customers over time, spreading that knowledge and eventually becoming seen as a subject matter expert in a specific field you’re passionate about.\\nPresidio encourages education in both technical and managerial skills, helping you become not just a better engineer but also a better person.\\nWhat energizes your work right now?\\nArtificial intelligence, especially in data center solutions, is what energizes my work right now. I want to understand how we can drive more of our customers to invest in data center solutions for artificial intelligence, not just to sell hardware but to enable their business through machine learning technologies.\\nWe have entire teams in India specifically that can help businesses drive business intelligence, which will ultimately drive their revenue higher. This, in turn, leads to more data center solutions that they need.

I think it is important for young people to learn about their community and strive to give back. It is equally important to learn about other cultures around the world. It’s a great way to learn how to lead. I have leveraged some of the skills and knowledge I learned through leading a scout group in projects here at Presidio.\\nX\\nSometimes it seems as if there are more solutions than problems.

I have been riding since my college days. I ride rode, mountain, and most recently – gravel biking. I have ridden in the deserts of Botswana, hills of Bosnia-Herzegovina, isles of Greece, shores of Europe and now seek out the trails of the United States.\\nHow do your personal hobbies translate to the work you do at Presidio?\\nLike cycling, there are times where you are alone and times when with a group. So, you must either grind yourself up a hill or down a long, winding road on your own, or there are times when you have assistance from the group, who encourage you and can even “pull” you by riding in front and providing a wind break.\\nDo you have any goals you are working towards this year? Either personal or in your job?\\nI have reach one already. After 30+ years serving our great nation, the United States, in a military capacity, I, Colonel Shinn, retired in June 2023. My next goal is to be there and give away my daughters on their wedding days; so far, one down and one more to go. I figured the weddings would be enough for this year.\\nWhat is a quote that you live by?\\nI have a few and drove my Soldiers and family crazy with my colloquial sayings. But I suspect I really have two I live by.\\nBe Bold, Be Brief, Be Gone: which translates, be confident in what you are saying and know the facts to stand by them; speak succinctly but specifically when presenting your topic; and do not seek accolades of your accomplished speech on your topic but move on as any compliments or questions will follow.\\nSometimes it seems as if there are more solutions than problems. On closer scrutiny, it turns out that many of today’s problems are a result of yesterday’s solutions. –Thomas Sowell\\nMake sure to understand the long-term ramifications of the choices and decisions one makes today. We humans, most of the time, want to solve the problem immediately, but the immediate may be the detriment of the distant.

I’m proud of things I’ve accomplished here, but I’m more proud of the things that they’ve accomplished here. I love seeing them grow.

And what keeps you here?\\nPresidio has given me a long-term career and prospects for continued growth.

The management teams I have worked with take a genuine interest in your life, your experience with your colleagues and customers, and your career progression.\\nWhat is it like working at Presidio?\\nNo day is ever the same – the technologies, customers, and teams involved in projects I manage are constantly changing.

Every season there’s a new challenge or something new to forecast for.\\n\\nMeet Amanda B\\nUnited States\\nWhat is your superpower? How does this superpower align with your work here at Presidio?\\nI’m a hobby farmer. Farming is an adventure where you can have a lot of success and a lot of failures. The failures can either cost your family food or time, or money. I grow between 30 to 40 different crops on a very small scale, but managing all those different ecosystems is very challenging. Every year comes with failures. I’ve had to learn over the seasons what works best.\\nIt’s like working in technology; it’s always changing.

All these different factors come into it, and you must adapt.\\nDo you have a special talent?\\nI am a Smart Hula-Hooper. My hula hoop is an internet of things (IoT) LED hula hoop that creates light images while you’re using it. I use code to make the light modes and the remote control to change the settings. The hoop also gets software updates from the manufacturer when plugged into a PC.\\nWhat is the best career advice you have ever been given?\\nI had a sales coach who told me that I had the gift of gab and that I shouldn’t be afraid of it but rather that I should find power in it and use it to my benefit.

This advice helped me find my own and it helped me come into myself as a person and recognize that my opinions matter and what I say has value.\\nHow do you view Presidio culture?\\nPresidio is probably my favorite company I’ve ever worked for. I think the reason for that is working at Presidio is kind of like watching words get written on a page while reading them out loud at the same time. So, you have input and output in the very same moment and that just creates this electricity and this vibe of everybody humming and buzzing.\\nX\\nOur team slogan is “do something great every day”.

We have a culture of people here who not only care but want Presidio to be the best and continuously make improvements to achieve that.\\nWhat’s a rule(s) that you live by?\\nThere would be two.

Our teacher once said something that stuck with me. He said, “Life is all clouds.” When a cloud comes in, good or bad, sit through it because it will change. You can’t control a cloud up in the sky. You can’t grab onto it, change it, or force it into something it’s not. Mindfulness is letting go of the things you cannot control. Just like good and bad experiences in life, each moment is temporary. Live it, and let it pass.\\nX\\nPresidio has a variety of IT solutions and vendors.

Studies show that 89% of B2B marketers utilize LinkedIn’s robust marketing tools and features to drive effective lead gen . Compared to other social networks, LinkedIn provides unmatched targeting capabilities and access to high-value decision-makers, making it the ideal platform to identify, engage, and convert relevant prospects for your software offerings.\\nOn top of that, LinkedIn (in my opinion) is the ONE platform where B2B buyers actually log on open and willing to be influenced on B2B buying decisions.\\nSavvy professionals and entrepreneurs log in to see what's trending in the world, what peers are doing, what tech is being used, what marketing trends are taking off etc. This makes it a truly unique and powerful weapon when you know what you're doing.\\nIn this guide, we’ll cover everything you need to know to maximize LinkedIn for generating quality software leads, from defining your target audience and optimizing your company presence to proven LinkedIn lead gen tactics and conversion strategies. We can also share top-performing LinkedIn ads for software companies with you.\\nTable of contents\\nDefining Your Target Audience is the Critical First Step\\nOptimizing Your LinkedIn Profile for LinkedIn Lead Gen\\nDeveloping a LinkedIn Content Strategy\\nLeveraging LinkedIn Ads to Drive Leads\\nContinually Optimize Based on Performance\\nNurturing and Converting Leads\\nDefining Your Target Audience is the Critical First Step\\nThe very first step to generating leads on LinkedIn is identifying who you want to target with LinkedIn Ads . The most effective approach is to focus your efforts on prospects that will gain the most value from your software solutions and, in return, provide the highest lifetime value to your business.\\nLinkedIn’s advanced filters and demographics allow you to precisely target your ideal customer profile (ICP) based on:\\nIndustry – Target prospects in your specific software niche, whether it’s marketing, sales, HR, design, etc.\\nCompany Size – Prioritize leads from small, mid-market, or enterprise companies.\\nJob Titles & Seniority – Target key decision-makers like VPs, directors, and managers.\\nGeographic Location – Focus on prospects in your ideal markets or territories.\\nFor even more refined targeting , LinkedIn Sales Navigator provides robust search features to find your best-fit accounts and contacts. You can create advanced Boolean searches combining multiple filters and keywords. For larger lead gen initiatives, consider teaming up with a LinkedIn ads agency that can tap into additional expertise to help identify and scale your efforts towards your highest-value prospects.\\nTaking the time upfront to clearly define your ICP will ensure your LinkedIn efforts are focused on the accounts and contacts that align best with your target customer profile.\\nHere is a great article on \\\"Is Sales Navigator Worth it?\\\"\\nOptimizing Your LinkedIn Profile for LinkedIn Lead Gen\\nWith 93% of recruiters reviewing LinkedIn profiles before engaging, having an optimized company presence is critical for lead gen.\\nRelated Article on Optimizing LinkedIn Personal Profile\\n1. LinkedIn Profile Photo & Branding Make a Strong First Impression\\nYour profile photo and background image are the first touchpoints prospects have with your brand on LinkedIn. Add a professional headshot of yourself or other executives and customize your background with your logo, mission statement, or relevant call-to-action. Your headline is valuable real estate – include target keywords that will resonate with your audience.\\nThink of your profile as a landing page that needs optimization if ICP quality traffic is hitting it.\\n2. LinkedIn Company Description Highlights Your Differentiators\\nYour company description is your chance to highlight what makes your software offering unique. Cover your origin story, passion areas, competitive differentiators, breadth of expertise, and range of offerings. Be sure to directly invite visitors to learn more or connect while providing clear contact info to drive engagement.\\nOne thing we've seen be true over and over again is that visiting someone's LinkedIn company page seems to be a key pit stop of many buyers during the consideration phase. It can be pretty critical to ensure you have at least the foundations in place here and, ideally, some content activity and engagement, if possible, to make it look like you're alive and kicking.\\nFollow LinkedIn Company Page Best Practices\\n3. Showcase Achievements to Demonstrate Credibility\\nDisplaying your company’s thought leadership, achievements, and customer traction builds credibility with prospects. Highlight company culture, awards won, important milestones, total customers, impressive customer logos, and advocacy in the form of customer testimonials. Social proof like client success stories and reviews powerfully showcase the results you deliver.\\n4. Build Your LinkedIn Network to Stay Top of Mind\\nProactively connecting and engaging with prospective clients, partners, and industry influencers provides a valuable feed of relevant insights. When influencers share content in your niche, like, comment, share, and post it yourself to establish your expertise. This keeps your brand top of mind while nurturing relationships.\\nGreat article here about the Pros and Cons of leveraging LinkedIn Automation Tools for this part of the strategy.\\nDeveloping a LinkedIn Content Strategy\\nSharing relevant, valuable content with your network generates 5x more profile views while keeping you top of mind with your audience.

I love that I have had the opportunity to work with some fantastic people in the US teams. The hybrid work environment that Presidio promotes is also a huge bonus in working here.\\nWhat is the culture like at Presidio?\\nI think Presidio has a really good culture of inclusivity and celebrating the diversity of the organization. As an Irish person, I love that we can learn about Black history and celebrate cultural events like Diwali through the company, for example. I really enjoy watching the Town Halls and company-wide presentations – especially when you get to see how people from different parts of the world work and operate.\\nDo you have any advice for women looking to get into the tech industry?\\nI would say try it out and see what suits you. My skills lie more on the admin and organizational side, but I found my place within a very technical group despite not being technical. I think a lot of women are put off technical roles because they think it’s going to involve a heavy physical element, but IT has changed a lot since I came into the industry in 2014 and there are a lot of roles and areas that don’t involve that kind of work anymore. I think the hybrid aspect of Presidio should be celebrated especially in an environment where a lot of companies are trying to get people back in the office full-time. That is a particularly good selling point.\\nWhat woman in your life inspires you? Why?\\nI am always inspired by ALL people who have overcome major odds to achieve things in life. My aunt Rose is one of those people. As a teenager she had epilepsy and had a fit one evening while sitting by a fire. She burned most of her left hand – she lost all her fingers and most of her thumb in the accident and had to spent months in a hospital in Dublin in the early 1960’s having painful skin grafts. Despite all that, she still made a very successful life as a wife, mother of 3 children and spent most of her life working in some shape or form – shop work, childminder and then a credit controller which she still does now, at 71 years of age!\\nShe never ever let the loss of her hand hold her back. She was my mother’s only sister, and we lost my mother when she was 44 (I was 18) so my aunt really became almost like a mother figure to me and we still have that bond, 35 years on.\\nX\\nMeet Joelle T.\\nSingapore\\nWhat is your favorite part of your role here at Presidio?\\nI work in Presidio Singapore, overseeing global customers. This May 2025 marks my fifth year with Presidio, and it has been an incredible journey of growth and learning. Throughout my role, I’ve had the privilege of working alongside colleagues, customers, and suppliers, all of whom have significantly contributed to my professional and personal development. My favorite part of working in my role is making those connections.\\nWhat is the culture like at Presidio?\\nI highly value the culture at Presidio which fosters a sense of belonging. One of which I believe is the most important is our focus on mental health. Mental Health is vital in maintaining a healthy and balanced work environment in the company. It is so important that we even have a Mental Health Day as an initiative to promote this value.\\nDo you have any advice for women looking to get into the tech industry?\\nTo fellow women whom aspires to break into the Tech industry – More and more women are making an impact in the industries. Just believe in your abilities, embrace continuous learning, and seize opportunities to make an impact!\\nX\\nMeet Joelle Tan\\nSingapore\\nWhat is your favorite part of your role here at Presidio?\\nI work in Presidio Singapore, overseeing global customers.

Developing friendships, and learning about new technologies is also a huge reason I stay at Presidio. Many businesses don’t necessarily develop the latest technologies because they have budgets to consider and existing business to run. At Presidio, you learn the latest technologies as soon as they’re available, and you can then apply them to other customers over time, spreading that knowledge and eventually becoming seen as a subject matter expert in a specific field you’re passionate about.\\nPresidio encourages education in both technical and managerial skills, helping you become not just a better engineer but also a better person.\\nWhat energizes your work right now?\\nArtificial intelligence, especially in data center solutions, is what energizes my work right now.

I have ridden in the deserts of Botswana, hills of Bosnia-Herzegovina, isles of Greece, shores of Europe and now seek out the trails of the United States.\\nHow do your personal hobbies translate to the work you do at Presidio?\\nLike cycling, there are times where you are alone and times when with a group.

My next goal is to be there and give away my daughters on their wedding days; so far, one down and one more to go. I figured the weddings would be enough for this year.\\nWhat is a quote that you live by?\\nI have a few and drove my Soldiers and family crazy with my colloquial sayings. But I suspect I really have two I live by.\\nBe Bold, Be Brief, Be Gone: which translates, be confident in what you are saying and know the facts to stand by them; speak succinctly but specifically when presenting your topic; and do not seek accolades of your accomplished speech on your topic but move on as any compliments or questions will follow.\\nSometimes it seems as if there are more solutions than problems. On closer scrutiny, it turns out that many of today’s problems are a result of yesterday’s solutions. –Thomas Sowell\\nMake sure to understand the long-term ramifications of the choices and decisions one makes today.

Every year comes with failures. I’ve had to learn over the seasons what works best.\\nIt’s like working in technology; it’s always changing.

This advice helped me find my own and it helped me come into myself as a person and recognize that my opinions matter and what I say has value.\\nHow do you view Presidio culture?\\nPresidio is probably my favorite company I’ve ever worked for. I think the reason for that is working at Presidio is kind of like watching words get written on a page while reading them out loud at the same time.

One thing I love about Presidio is that Presidio cares about the people that work here. We have a culture of people here who not only care but want Presidio to be the best and continuously make improvements to achieve that.\\nWhat’s a rule(s) that you live by?\\nThere would be two. The first would be “Gratitude is the gateway to joy,” and the second is, “You miss 100% of the opportunities you don’t take.”\\nThe gratitude quote – It is easy to get wrapped up in everything around you when there is always so much going on.

As a parent, I often read the same stories my kids do! Reading was an activity that my son and I really enjoyed.

I shared it with my son, and he was so excited about it. Since then, the stories have continued, and now I have published five novels.\\nHow do your personal hobbies translate to the work you do at Presidio?\\nI love creating stories that energize people and make them feel good.

Our teacher once said something that stuck with me. He said, “Life is all clouds.” When a cloud comes in, good or bad, sit through it because it will change. You can’t control a cloud up in the sky. You can’t grab onto it, change it, or force it into something it’s not. Mindfulness is letting go of the things you cannot control. Just like good and bad experiences in life, each moment is temporary. Live it, and let it pass.\\nX\\nPresidio has a variety of IT solutions and vendors.

Through my creative background, I bring a unique perspective to the team, enabling me to approach projects with a creative mindset.

How does this superpower align with your work here at Presidio?\\nI’m a hobby farmer. Farming is an adventure where you can have a lot of success and a lot of failures.

This advice helped me find my own and it helped me come into myself as a person and recognize that my opinions matter and what I say has value.\\nHow do you view Presidio culture?\\nPresidio is probably my favorite company I’ve ever worked for. I think the reason for that is working at Presidio is kind of like watching words get written on a page while reading them out loud at the same time.
