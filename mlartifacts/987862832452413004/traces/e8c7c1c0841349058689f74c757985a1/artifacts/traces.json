I will focus on LinkedIn-specific search tactics, including keywords and filters, to optimize lead generation within the constraints of search depth, maximum leads, and the campaign goal of booking demos. I will leverage my knowledge of LinkedIn's search parameters and company profiles to ensure the plan is precise and actionable. To complete this, I plan to generate a set of relevant keywords, define target company attributes (such as industry, size, location, etc.), and outline search strategies that maximize relevance and efficiency. I recognize potential challenges such as keyword ambiguity or overlapping search results, which I will address by refining terms and filters.
