Direct Search: Use the exact search strategy provided by the user 2. Keyword Variations: Modify the search strategy with different keywords 3. Industry-Specific: Add industry terms to the search strategy 4. Location-Based: Add location terms to the search strategy 5. Job Title Focus: Add job title terms to the search strategy 6. Company Focus: Add company-specific terms to the search strategy\\nEXECUTION PLAN: 1. Start with the user's search strategy, extract leads, EVALUATE EACH LEAD for quality 2. Only count leads that meet ALL quality criteria as valid 3. If you haven't reached 50 QUALIFIED leads, try keyword variations 4. Continue through all approaches until you have exactly 50 high-quality leads 5. After each approach, report: \\\"Found X QUALIFIED leads so far, need Y more\\\" 6. Do not stop until you have exactly 50 leads that meet quality standards\\nLEAD EVALUATION PROCESS: For each potential lead found: - Check if their title/role matches target clients - Verify their company is relevant to search strategy - Ensure they have decision-making authority - Confirm their profile is complete and professional - Only include if they meet ALL quality criteria\\nOUTPUT FORMAT: Return a JSON array with exactly 50 HIGH-QUALITY lead objects, each containing: - name: Lead's full name - company: Company name - title: Job title - linkedin: LinkedIn profile URL (if available) - email: (leave empty, will be filled by email finder)\\nREMEMBER: Your target is 50 HIGH-QUALITY leads.
